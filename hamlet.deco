ACT I. Scene I.
Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.

Enter two Sentinelsfirst, Francisco, who paces up and down
at his post then ernardo, who approaches him.

  er. Whos there.
  Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
  er. Long lie the King
  Fran. ernardo
  er. He.
  Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
  er. Tis now struck twele. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
  Fran. For this relief much thanks. Tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick at heart.
  er. Hae you had uiet guard
  Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
  er. Well, good night.
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rials of my watch, bid them make haste.

                    Enter Horatio and Marcellus.  

  Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho Who is there
  Hor. Friends to this ground.
  Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
  Fran. Gie you good night.
  Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
    Who hath relied you
  Fran. ernardo hath my place.
    Gie you good night.                                   Eit.
  Mar. Holla, ernardo
  er. Say
    What, is Horatio there 
  Hor. A piece of him.
  er. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
  Mar. What, has this thing appeard again tonight
  er. I hae seen nothing.
  Mar. Horatio says tis but our fantasy,
    And will not let belief take hold of him
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
    Therefore I hae entreated him along,  
    With us to watch the minutes of this night,
    That, if again this apparition come,
    He may approe our eyes and speak to it.
  Hor. Tush, tush, twill not appear.
  er. Sit down awhile,
    And let us once again assail your ears,
    That are so fortified against our story,
    What we two nights hae seen.
  Hor. Well, sit we down,
    And let us hear ernardo speak of this.
  er. Last night of all,
    When yond same star thats westward from the pole
    Had made his course t illume that part of heaen
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    The bell then beating one

                        Enter Ghost.

  Mar. Peace break thee off Look where it comes again
  er. In the same figure, like the King thats dead.  
  Mar. Thou art a scholar speak to it, Horatio.
  er. Looks it not like the King Mark it, Horatio.
  Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
  er. It would be spoke to.
  Mar. uestion it, Horatio.
  Hor. What art thou that usurpst this time of night
    Together with that fair and warlike form
    In which the maesty of buried Denmark
    Did sometimes march y heaen I charge thee speak
  Mar. It is offended.
  er. See, it stalks away
  Hor. Stay Speak, speak I charge thee speak
                                                     Eit Ghost.
  Mar. Tis gone and will not answer.
  er. How now, Horatio You tremble and look pale.
    Is not this something more than fantasy
    What think you ont
  Hor. efore my God, I might not this beliee
    Without the sensible and true aouch
    Of mine own eyes.  
  Mar. Is it not like the King
  Hor. As thou art to thyself.
    Such was the ery armour he had on
    When he th ambitious Norway combated.
    So frownd he once when, in an angry parle,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    Tis strange.
  Mar. Thus twice before, and ump at this dead hour,
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
  Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not
    ut, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
  Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
    Why this same strict and most obserant watch
    So nightly toils the subect of the land,
    And why such daily cast of braen cannon
    And foreign mart for implements of war
    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
    Does not diide the Sunday from the week.
    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste  
    Doth make the night ointlabourer with the day
    Who ist that can inform me
  Hor. That can I.
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
    Whose image een but now appeard to us,
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    Thereto prickd on by a most emulate pride,
    Dard to the combat in which our aliant Hamlet
    For so this side of our known world esteemd him
    Did slay this Fortinbras who, by a seald compact,
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
    Which he stood seid of, to the conueror
    Against the which a moiety competent
    Was gaged by our king which had returnd
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    Had he been anuisher, as, by the same comart
    And carriage of the article designd,
    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
    Of unimproed mettle hot and full,  
    Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
    Sharkd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    For food and diet, to some enterprise
    That hath a stomach int which is no other,
    As it doth well appear unto our state,
    ut to recoer of us, by strong hand
    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
    So by his father lost and this, I take it,
    Is the main motie of our preparations,
    The source of this our watch, and the chief head
    Of this posthaste and romage in the land.
  er. I think it be no other but een so.
    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
    Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
    That was and is the uestion of these wars.
  Hor. A mote it is to trouble the minds eye.
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
    A little ere the mightiest ulius fell,
    The graes stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
    Did sueak and gibber in the Roman streets  
    As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
    Disasters in the sun and the moist star
    pon whose influence Neptunes empire stands
    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
    And een the like precurse of fierce eents,
    As harbingers preceding still the fates
    And prologue to the omen coming on,
    Hae heaen and earth together demonstrated
    nto our climature and countrymen.

                      Enter Ghost again.

    ut soft behold Lo, where it comes again
    Ill cross it, though it blast me. Stay illusion
                                               Spreads his arms.
    If thou hast any sound, or use of oice,
    Speak to me.
    If there be any good thing to be done,
    That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
    Speak to me.  
    If thou art priy to thy countrys fate,
    Which happily foreknowing may aoid,
    O, speak
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Etorted treasure in the womb of earth
    For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
                                                 The cock crows.
    Speak of it Stay, and speak Stop it, Marcellus
  Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan
  Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
  er. Tis here
  Hor. Tis here
  Mar. Tis gone
                                                     Eit Ghost.
    We do it wrong, being so maestical,
    To offer it the show of iolence
    For it is as the air, inulnerable,
    And our ain blows malicious mockery.
  er. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
  Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing  
    pon a fearful summons. I hae heard
    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
    Doth with his lofty and shrillsounding throat
    Awake the god of day and at his warning,
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    Th etraagant and erring spirit hies
    To his confine and of the truth herein
    This present obect made probation.
  Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
    Some say that eer, gainst that season comes
    Wherein our Saiours birth is celebrated,
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long
    And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
    The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
    So hallowd and so gracious is the time.
  Hor. So hae I heard and do in part beliee it.
    ut look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks oer the dew of yon high eastward hill.
    reak we our watch up and by my adice  
    Let us impart what we hae seen tonight
    nto young Hamlet for, upon my life,
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    Do you consent we shall acuaint him with it,
    As needful in our loes, fitting our duty
    Lets dot, I pray and I this morning know
    Where we shall find him most coneniently.           Eeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.

Flourish. Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the ueen, Hamlet,
Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, oltemand, Cornelius,
Lords Attendant.

  King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brothers death
    The memory be green, and that it us befitted
    To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
    That we with wisest sorrow think on him
    Together with remembrance of ourseles.
    Therefore our sometime sister, now our ueen,
    Th imperial ointress to this warlike state,
    Hae we, as twere with a defeated oy,
    With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
    With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
    In eual scale weighing delight and dole,
    Taken to wife nor hae we herein barrd
    Your better wisdoms, which hae freely gone  
    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
    Or thinking by our late dear brothers death
    Our state to be disoint and out of frame,
    Colleagued with this dream of his adantage,
    He hath not faild to pester us with message
    Importing the surrender of those lands
    Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
    To our most aliant brother. So much for him.
    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
    Thus much the business is we hae here writ
    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
    Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
    Of this his nephews purpose, to suppress
    His further gait herein, in that the leies,
    The lists, and full proportions are all made
    Out of his subect and we here dispatch
    You, good Cornelius, and you, oltemand,
    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,  
    Giing to you no further personal power
    To business with the King, more than the scope
    Of these dilated articles allow.            Gies a paper.
    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
  Cor., olt. In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
  King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
                                 Eeunt oltemand and Cornelius.
    And now, Laertes, whats the news with you
    You told us of some suit. What ist, Laertes
    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
    And lose your oice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking
    The head is not more natie to the heart,
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
    What wouldst thou hae, Laertes
  Laer. My dread lord,
    Your leae and faour to return to France
    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
    To show my duty in your coronation,  
    Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
    And bow them to your gracious leae and pardon.
  King. Hae you your fathers leae What says Polonius
  Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leae
    y laboursome petition, and at last
    pon his will I seald my hard consent.
    I do beseech you gie him leae to go.
  King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
    And thy best graces spend it at thy will
    ut now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son
  Ham. aside A little more than kin, and less than kind
  King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you
  Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i th sun.
  ueen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
    Do not for eer with thy ailed lids
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
    Thou knowst tis common. All that lies must die,
    Passing through nature to eternity.  
  Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
  ueen. If it be,
    Why seems it so particular with thee
  Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not seems.
    Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
    Nor windy suspiration of forcd breath,
    No, nor the fruitful rier in the eye,
    Nor the deected haior of the isage,
    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
    That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
    For they are actions that a man might play
    ut I hae that within which passeth show
    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
  King. Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
    To gie these mourning duties to your father
    ut you must know, your father lost a father
    That father lost, lost his, and the surior bound
    In filial obligation for some term
    To do obseuious sorrow. ut to perseer  
    In obstinate condolement is a course
    Of impious stubbornness. Tis unmanly grief
    It shows a will most incorrect to heaen,
    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
    An understanding simple and unschoold
    For what we know must be, and is as common
    As any the most ulgar thing to sense,
    Why should we in our peeish opposition
    Take it to heart Fie tis a fault to heaen,
    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
    To reason most absurd, whose common theme
    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
    From the first corse till he that died today,
    This must be so. We pray you throw to earth
    This unpreailing woe, and think of us
    As of a father for let the world take note
    You are the most immediate to our throne,
    And with no less nobility of loe
    Than that which dearest father bears his son
    Do I impart toward you. For your intent  
    In going back to school in Wittenberg,
    It is most retrograde to our desire
    And we beseech you, bend you to remain
    Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
  ueen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
    I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
  Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
  King. Why, tis a loing and a fair reply.
    e as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
    This gentle and unforcd accord of Hamlet
    Sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof,
    No ocund health that Denmark drinks today
    ut the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
    And the Kings rouse the heaen shall bruit again,
    Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
                                Flourish. Eeunt all but Hamlet.
  Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
    Thaw, and resole itself into a dew
    Or that the Eerlasting had not fid  
    His canon gainst selfslaughter O God God
    How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
    Seem to me all the uses of this world
    Fie ont ah, fie Tis an unweeded garden
    That grows to seed things rank and gross in nature
    Possess it merely. That it should come to this
    ut two months dead Nay, not so much, not two.
    So ecellent a king, that was to this
    Hyperion to a satyr so loing to my mother
    That he might not beteem the winds of heaen
    isit her face too roughly. Heaen and earth
    Must I remember Why, she would hang on him
    As if increase of appetite had grown
    y what it fed on and yet, within a month
    Let me not think ont Frailty, thy name is woman
    A little month, or ere those shoes were old
    With which she followed my poor fathers body
    Like Niobe, all tears why she, een she
    O God a beast that wants discourse of reason
    Would hae mournd longer married with my uncle  
    My fathers brother, but no more like my father
    Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
    With such deterity to incestuous sheets
    It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
    ut break my heart, for I must hold my tongue

          Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and ernardo.

  Hor. Hail to your lordship
  Ham. I am glad to see you well.
    Horatio or I do forget myself.
  Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor serant eer.
  Ham. Sir, my good friend Ill change that name with you.
    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio
    Marcellus
  Mar. My good lord
  Ham. I am ery glad to see you. To ernardo Good een, sir.  
    ut what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg
  Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
  Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
    Nor shall you do my ear that iolence
    To make it truster of your own report
    Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
    ut what is your affair in Elsinore
    Well teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
  Hor. My lord, I came to see your fathers funeral.
  Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
    I think it was to see my mothers wedding.
  Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
  Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio The funeral bakd meats
    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaen
    Or eer I had seen that day, Horatio
    My father methinks I see my father.
  Hor. O, where, my lord
  Ham. In my minds eye, Horatio.
  Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.  
  Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
    I shall not look upon his like again.
  Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
  Ham. Saw who
  Hor. My lord, the King your father.
  Ham. The King my father
  Hor. Season your admiration for a while
    With an attent ear, till I may delier
    pon the witness of these gentlemen,
    This marel to you.
  Ham. For Gods loe let me hear
  Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen
    Marcellus and ernardo on their watch
    In the dead ast and middle of the night
    een thus encountred. A figure like your father,
    Armed at point eactly, capape,
    Appears before them and with solemn march
    Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walkd
    y their oppressd and fearsurprised eyes,
    Within his truncheons length whilst they distilld  
    Almost to elly with the act of fear,
    Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
    In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
    And I with them the third night kept the watch
    Where, as they had delierd, both in time,
    Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
    The apparition comes. I knew your father.
    These hands are not more like.
  Ham. ut where was this
  Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watchd.
  Ham. Did you not speak to it
  Hor. My lord, I did
    ut answer made it none. Yet once methought
    It lifted up it head and did address
    Itself to motion, like as it would speak
    ut een then the morning cock crew loud,
    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
    And anishd from our sight.
  Ham. Tis ery strange.
  Hor. As I do lie, my honourd lord, tis true  
    And we did think it writ down in our duty
    To let you know of it.
  Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. ut this troubles me.
    Hold you the watch tonight
  oth Mar. and er. We do, my lord.
  Ham. Armd, say you
  oth. Armd, my lord.
  Ham. From top to toe
  oth. My lord, from head to foot.
  Ham. Then saw you not his face
  Hor. O, yes, my lord He wore his beaer up.
  Ham. What, lookd he frowningly.
  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
  Ham. Pale or red
  Hor. Nay, ery pale.
  Ham. And fid his eyes upon you
  Hor. Most constantly.
  Ham. I would I had been there.
  Hor. It would hae much amad you.
  Ham. ery like, ery like. Stayd it long  
  Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
  oth. Longer, longer.
  Hor. Not when I sawt.
  Ham. His beard was griled no
  Hor. It was, as I hae seen it in his life,
    A sable silerd.
  Ham. I will watch tonight.
    Perchance twill walk again.
  Hor. I warrnt it will.
  Ham. If it assume my noble fathers person,
    Ill speak to it, though hell itself should gape
    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
    If you hae hitherto conceald this sight,
    Let it be tenable in your silence still
    And whatsoeer else shall hap tonight,
    Gie it an understanding but no tongue.
    I will reuite your loes. So, fare you well.
    pon the platform, twit eleen and twele,
    Ill isit you.
  All. Our duty to your honour.  
  Ham. Your loes, as mine to you. Farewell.
                                        Eeunt all but Hamlet.
    My fathers spirit in arms All is not well.
    I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come
    Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
    Though all the earth oerwhelm them, to mens eyes.
Eit.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Laertes and Ophelia.

  Laer. My necessaries are embarkd. Farewell.
    And, sister, as the winds gie benefit
    And conoy is assistant, do not sleep,
    ut let me hear from you.
  Oph. Do you doubt that
  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his faour,
    Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood
    A iolet in the youth of primy nature,
    Forward, not permanent sweet, not lasting
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute
    No more.
  Oph. No more but so
  Laer. Think it no more.
    For nature crescent does not grow alone
    In thews and bulk but as this temple waes,
    The inward serice of the mind and soul
    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loes you now,  
    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
    The irtue of his will but you must fear,
    His greatness weighd, his will is not his own
    For he himself is subect to his birth.
    He may not, as unalued persons do,
    Care for himself, for on his choice depends
    The safety and health of this whole state,
    And therefore must his choice be circumscribd
    nto the oice and yielding of that body
    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loes you,
    It fits your wisdom so far to beliee it
    As he in his particular act and place
    May gie his saying deed which is no further
    Than the main oice of Denmark goes withal.
    Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
    Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
    To his unmastred importunity.
    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
    And keep you in the rear of your affection,  
    Out of the shot and danger of desire.
    The chariest maid is prodigal enough
    If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
    irtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes.
    The canker galls the infants of the spring
    Too oft before their buttons be disclosd,
    And in the morn and liuid dew of youth
    Contagious blastments are most imminent.
    e wary then best safety lies in fear.
    Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
  Oph. I shall th effect of this good lesson keep
    As watchman to my heart. ut, good my brother,
    Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaen,
    Whiles, like a puffd and reckless libertine,
    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
    And recks not his own rede.
  Laer. O, fear me not

                       Enter Polonius.  

    I stay too long. ut here my father comes.
    A double blessing is a double grace
    Occasion smiles upon a second leae.
  Pol. Yet here, Laertes Aboard, aboard, for shame
    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
    And you are stayd for. There my blessing with thee
    And these few precepts in thy memory
    Look thou character. Gie thy thoughts no tongue,
    Nor any unproportiond thought his act.
    e thou familiar, but by no means ulgar
    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
    Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel
    ut do not dull thy palm with entertainment
    Of each newhatchd, unfledgd comrade. eware
    Of entrance to a uarrel but being in,
    eart that th opposed may beware of thee.
    Gie eery man thine ear, but few thy oice
    Take each mans censure, but resere thy udgment.
    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,  
    ut not epressd in fancy rich, not gaudy
    For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
    And they in France of the best rank and station
    Are most select and generous, chief in that.
    Neither a borrower nor a lender be
    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
    This aboe all to thine own self be true,
    And it must follow, as the night the day,
    Thou canst not then be false to any man.
    Farewell. My blessing season this in thee
  Laer. Most humbly do I take my leae, my lord.
  Pol. The time inites you. Go, your serants tend.
  Laer. Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
    What I hae said to you.
  Oph. Tis in my memory lockd,
    And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
  Laer. Farewell.                                          Eit.
  Pol. What ist, Ophelia, he hath said to you
  Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.  
  Pol. Marry, well bethought
    Tis told me he hath ery oft of late
    Gien priate time to you, and you yourself
    Hae of your audience been most free and bounteous.
    If it be so as so tis put on me,
    And that in way of caution I must tell you
    You do not understand yourself so clearly
    As it behooes my daughter and your honour.
    What is between you Gie me up the truth.
  Oph. He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
    Of his affection to me.
  Pol. Affection Pooh You speak like a green girl,
    nsifted in such perilous circumstance.
    Do you beliee his tenders, as you call them
  Oph. I do not know, my lord, what I should think,
  Pol. Marry, I will teach you Think yourself a baby
    That you hae taen these tenders for true pay,
    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
    Or not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
    Running it thus youll tender me a fool.  
  Oph. My lord, he hath importund me with loe
    In honourable fashion.
  Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to
  Oph. And hath gien countenance to his speech, my lord,
    With almost all the holy ows of heaen.
  Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks I do know,
    When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
    Lends the tongue ows. These blaes, daughter,
    Giing more light than heat, etinct in both
    Een in their promise, as it is amaking,
    You must not take for fire. From this time
    e something scanter of your maiden presence.
    Set your entreatments at a higher rate
    Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
    eliee so much in him, that he is young,
    And with a larger tether may he walk
    Than may be gien you. In few, Ophelia,
    Do not beliee his ows for they are brokers,
    Not of that dye which their inestments show,
    ut mere implorators of unholy suits,  
    reathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
    The better to beguile. This is for all
    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
    Hae you so slander any moment leisure
    As to gie words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
    Look tot, I charge you. Come your ways.
  Oph. I shall obey, my lord.
                                                         Eeunt.




Scene I.
Elsinore. The platform before the Castle.

Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.

  Ham. The air bites shrewdly it is ery cold.
  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.
  Ham. What hour now
  Hor. I think it lacks of twele.
  Mar. No, it is struck.
  Hor. Indeed I heard it not. It then draws near the season
    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
                   A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces go off.
    What does this mean, my lord
  Ham. The King doth wake tonight and takes his rouse,
    Keeps wassail, and the swaggring upspring reels,
    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
    The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
    The triumph of his pledge.
  Hor. Is it a custom
  Ham. Ay, marry, ist
    ut to my mind, though I am natie here  
    And to the manner born, it is a custom
    More honourd in the breach than the obserance.
    This heayheaded reel east and west
    Makes us traducd and tad of other nations
    They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
    Soil our addition and indeed it takes
    From our achieements, though performd at height,
    The pith and marrow of our attribute.
    So oft it chances in particular men
    That, for some icious mole of nature in them,
    As in their birth, wherein they are not guilty,
    Since nature cannot choose his origin,
    y the oergrowth of some compleion,
    Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
    Or by some habit that too much oerleaens
    The form of plausie manners, that these men
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
    eing natures liery, or fortunes star,
    Their irtues else be they as pure as grace,
    As infinite as man may undergo  
    Shall in the general censure take corruption
    From that particular fault. The dram of eil
    Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal.

                         Enter Ghost.

  Hor. Look, my lord, it comes
  Ham. Angels and ministers of grace defend us
    e thou a spirit of health or goblin damnd,
    ring with thee airs from heaen or blasts from hell,
    e thy intents wicked or charitable,
    Thou comst in such a uestionable shape
    That I will speak to thee. Ill call thee Hamlet,
    King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me
    Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
    Why thy canonid bones, hearsed in death,
    Hae burst their cerements why the sepulchre
    Wherein we saw thee uietly inurnd,
    Hath opd his ponderous and marble aws
    To cast thee up again. What may this mean  
    That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
    Reisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
    Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
    So horridly to shake our disposition
    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls
    Say, why is this wherefore What should we do
                                           Ghost beckons Hamlet.
  Hor. It beckons you to go away with it,
    As if it some impartment did desire
    To you alone.
  Mar. Look with what courteous action
    It waes you to a more remoed ground.
    ut do not go with it
  Hor. No, by no means
  Ham. It will not speak. Then will I follow it.
  Hor. Do not, my lord
  Ham. Why, what should be the fear
    I do not set my life at a pins fee
    And for my soul, what can it do to that,
    eing a thing immortal as itself  
    It waes me forth again. Ill follow it.
  Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
    That beetles oer his base into the sea,
    And there assume some other, horrible form
    Which might deprie your soereignty of reason
    And draw you into madness Think of it.
    The ery place puts toys of desperation,
    Without more motie, into eery brain
    That looks so many fadoms to the sea
    And hears it roar beneath.
  Ham. It waes me still.
    Go on. Ill follow thee.
  Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
  Ham. Hold off your hands
  Hor. e ruld. You shall not go.
  Ham. My fate cries out
    And makes each petty artire in this body
    As hardy as the Nemean lions nere.
                                                Ghost beckons.  
    Still am I calld. nhand me, gentlemen.
    y heaen, Ill make a ghost of him that lets me
    I say, away Go on. Ill follow thee.
                                        Eeunt Ghost and Hamlet.
  Hor. He waes desperate with imagination.
  Mar. Lets follow. Tis not fit thus to obey him.
  Hor. Hae after. To what issue wail this come
  Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
  Hor. Heaen will direct it.
  Mar. Nay, lets follow him.
                                                         Eeunt.




Scene .
Elsinore. The Castle. Another part of the fortifications.

Enter Ghost and Hamlet.

  Ham. Whither wilt thou lead me Speak Ill go no further.
  Ghost. Mark me.
  Ham. I will.
  Ghost. My hour is almost come,
    When I to sulphrous and tormenting flames
    Must render up myself.
  Ham. Alas, poor ghost
  Ghost. Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
    To what I shall unfold.
  Ham. Speak. I am bound to hear.
  Ghost. So art thou to reenge, when thou shalt hear.
  Ham. What
  Ghost. I am thy fathers spirit,
    Doomd for a certain term to walk the night,
    And for the day confind to fast in fires,
    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
    Are burnt and purgd away. ut that I am forbid  
    To tell the secrets of my prison house,
    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
    Would harrow up thy soul, freee thy young blood,
    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
    Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
    And each particular hair to stand an end
    Like uills upon the fretful porpentine.
    ut this eternal blaon must not be
    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list
    If thou didst eer thy dear father loe
  Ham. O God
  Ghost. Reenge his foul and most unnatural murther.
  Ham. Murther
  Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is
    ut this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
  Ham. Haste me to knowt, that I, with wings as swift
    As meditation or the thoughts of loe,
    May sweep to my reenge.
  Ghost. I find thee apt
    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed  
    That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
    Tis gien out that, sleeping in my orchard,
    A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark
    Is by a forged process of my death
    Rankly abusd. ut know, thou noble youth,
    The serpent that did sting thy fathers life
    Now wears his crown.
  Ham. O my prophetic soul
    My uncle
  Ghost. Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts
    O wicked wit and gifts, that hae the power
    So to seduce won to his shameful lust
    The will of my most seemingirtuous ueen.
    O Hamlet, what a fallingoff was there,
    From me, whose loe was of that dignity
    That it went hand in hand een with the ow
    I made to her in marriage, and to decline
    pon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor  
    To those of mine
    ut irtue, as it neer will be mod,
    Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaen,
    So lust, though to a radiant angel linkd,
    Will sate itself in a celestial bed
    And prey on garbage.
    ut soft methinks I scent the morning air.
    rief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
    My custom always of the afternoon,
    pon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
    With uice of cursed hebona in a ial,
    And in the porches of my ears did pour
    The leperous distilment whose effect
    Holds such an enmity with blood of man
    That swift as uicksilerr it courses through
    The natural gates and alleys of the body,
    And with a sudden igour it doth posset
    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
    The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine
    And a most instant tetter barkd about,  
    Most laarlike, with ile and loathsome crust
    All my smooth body.
    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brothers hand
    Of life, of crown, of ueen, at once dispatchd
    Cut off een in the blossoms of my sin,
    nhousled, disappointed, unaneld,
    No reckoning made, but sent to my account
    With all my imperfections on my head.
  Ham. O, horrible O, horrible most horrible
  Ghost. If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
    A couch for luury and damned incest.
    ut, howsoeer thou pursuest this act,
    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrie
    Against thy mother aught. Leae her to heaen,
    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
    The glowworm shows the matin to be near
    And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
    Adieu, adieu, adieu Remember me.                      Eit.  
  Ham. O all you host of heaen O earth What else
    And shall I couple hell Hold, hold, my heart
    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
    ut bear me stiffly up. Remember thee
    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
    In this distracted globe. Remember thee
    Yea, from the table of my memory
    Ill wipe away all triial fond records,
    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
    That youth and obseration copied there,
    And thy commandment all alone shall lie
    Within the book and olume of my brain,
    nmid with baser matter. Yes, by heaen
    O most pernicious woman
    O illain, illain, smiling, damned illain
    My tables Meet it is I set it down
    That one may smile, and smile, and be a illain
    At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.        Writes.
    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word
    It is Adieu, adieu Remember me.  
    I hae swornt.
  Hor. within My lord, my lord

                   Enter Horatio and Marcellus.

  Mar. Lord Hamlet
  Hor. Heaen secure him
  Ham. So be it
  Mar. Illo, ho, ho, my lord
  Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy Come, bird, come.
  Mar. How ist, my noble lord
  Hor. What news, my lord
  Mar. O, wonderful
  Hor. Good my lord, tell it.
  Ham. No, you will reeal it.
  Hor. Not I, my lord, by heaen
  Mar. Nor I, my lord.
  Ham. How say you then Would heart of man once think it
    ut youll be secret
  oth. Ay, by heaen, my lord.  
  Ham. Theres neer a illain dwelling in all Denmark
    ut hes an arrant knae.
  Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grae
    To tell us this.
  Ham. Why, right You are in the right
    And so, without more circumstance at all,
    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part
    You, as your business and desires shall point you,
    For eery man hath business and desire,
    Such as it is and for my own poor part,
    Look you, Ill go pray.
  Hor. These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
  Ham. I am sorry they offend you, heartily
    Yes, faith, heartily.
  Hor. Theres no offence, my lord.
  Ham. Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
    And much offence too. Touching this ision here,
    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
    For your desire to know what is between us,
    Oermastert as you may. And now, good friends,  
    As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
    Gie me one poor reuest.
  Hor. What ist, my lord We will.
  Ham. Neer make known what you hae seen tonight.

  Ham. Nay, but sweart.
  Hor. In faith,
    My lord, not I.
  Mar. Nor I, my lord in faith.
  Ham. pon my sword.
  Mar. We hae sworn, my lord, already.
  Ham. Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.

                 Ghost cries under the stage.

  Ghost. Swear.
  Ham. Aha boy, sayst thou so Art thou there, truepenny
    Come on You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
    Consent to swear.
  Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.

  Ghost. beneath Swear by his sword.
  Ham. Well said, old mole Canst work i th earth so fast
    A worthy pioner Once more remoe, good friends.
  Hor. O day and night, but this is wondrous strange
  Ham. And therefore as a stranger gie it welcome.
    There are more things in heaen and earth, Horatio,
    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
    ut come
    Here, as before, neer, so help you mercy,
    How strange or odd soeer I bear myself
    As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
    To put an antic disposition on,

    Or If we list to speak, or There be, an if they might,

Act II. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius.

Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.

  Pol. Gie him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
  Rey. I will, my lord.
  Pol. You shall do marells wisely, good Reynaldo,
    efore You isit him, to make inuire
    Of his behaiour.
  Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
  Pol. Marry, well said, ery well said. Look you, sir,
    Enuire me first what Danskers are in Paris
    And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
    What company, at what epense and finding
    y this encompassment and drift of uestion
    That they do know my son, come you more nearer
    Than your particular demands will touch it.
    Take you, as twere, some distant knowledge of him
    As thus, I know his father and his friends,
    And in part him. Do you mark this, Reynaldo
  Rey. Ay, ery well, my lord.  
  Pol. And in part him, but, you may say, not well.
    ut ift be he I mean, hes ery wild
    Addicted so and so and there put on him
    What forgeries you please marry, none so rank
    As may dishonour him take heed of that
    ut, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
    As are companions noted and most known
    To youth and liberty.
  Rey. As gaming, my lord.
  Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, uarrelling,
    Drabbing. You may go so far.
  Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.
  Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
    You must not put another scandal on him,
    That he is open to incontinency.
    Thats not my meaning. ut breathe his faults so uaintly
    That they may seem the taints of liberty,
    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    A saageness in unreclaimed blood,
    Of general assault.  
  Rey. ut, my good lord
  Pol. Wherefore should you do this
  Rey. Ay, my lord,
    I would know that.
  Pol. Marry, sir, heres my drift,
    And I beliee it is a fetch of warrant.
    You laying these slight sullies on my son
    As twere a thing a little soild i th working,
    Mark you,
    Your party in conerse, him you would sound,
    Haing eer seen in the prenominate crimes
    The youth you breathe of guilty, be assurd
    He closes with you in this conseuence
    Good sir, or so, or friend, or gentleman
    According to the phrase or the addition
    Of man and country
  Rey. ery good, my lord.
  Pol. And then, sir, does a this a does What was I about to say
    y the mass, I was about to say something Where did I leae
  Rey. At closes in the conseuence, at friend or so, and  
    gentleman.
  Pol. At closes in the conseuence Ay, marry
    He closes thus I know the gentleman.
    I saw him yesterday, or tother day,
    Or then, or then, with such or such and, as you say,
    There was a gaming there oertook ins rouse
    There falling out at tennis or perchance,
    I saw him enter such a house of sale,
    idelicet, a brothel, or so forth.
    See you now
    Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth
    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
    With windlasses and with assays of bias,
    y indirections find directions out.
    So, by my former lecture and adice,
    Shall you my son. You hae me, hae you not
  Rey. My lord, I hae.
  Pol. God b wi ye, fare ye well
  Rey. Good my lord                                    Going.
  Pol. Obsere his inclination in yourself.  
  Rey. I shall, my lord.
  Pol. And let him ply his music.
  Rey. Well, my lord.
  Pol. Farewell
                                                  Eit Reynaldo.

                       Enter Ophelia.

    How now, Ophelia Whats the matter
  Oph. O my lord, my lord, I hae been so affrighted
  Pol. With what, i th name of God I
  Oph. My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbracd,
    No hat upon his head, his stockings fould,
    ngartred, and downgyed to his ankle
    Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
    And with a look so piteous in purport
    As if he had been loosed out of hell
    To speak of horrors he comes before me.
  Pol. Mad for thy loe  
  Oph. My lord, I do not know,
    ut truly I do fear it.
  Pol. What said he
  Oph. He took me by the wrist and held me hard
    Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
    And, with his other hand thus oer his brow,
    He falls to such perusal of my face
    As he would draw it. Long stayd he so.
    At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
    And thrice his head thus waing up and down,
    He raisd a sigh so piteous and profound
    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
    And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
    And with his head oer his shoulder turnd
    He seemd to find his way without his eyes,
    For out o doors he went without their help
    And to the last bended their light on me.
  Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
    This is the ery ecstasy of loe,
    Whose iolent property fordoes itself  
    And leads the will to desperate undertakings
    As oft as any passion under heaen
    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
    What, hae you gien him any hard words of late
  Oph. No, my good lord but, as you did command,
    I did repel his letters and denied
    His access to me.
  Pol. That hath made him mad.
    I am sorry that with better heed and udgment
    I had not uoted him. I feard he did but trifle
    And meant to wrack thee but beshrew my ealousy
    y heaen, it is as proper to our age
    To cast beyond ourseles in our opinions
    As it is common for the younger sort
    To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
    This must be known which, being kept close, might moe
    More grief to hide than hate to utter loe.
    Come.
                                                         Eeunt.

Scene II.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Flourish. Enter King and ueen, Rosencrant and Guildenstern, cum aliis.

  King. Welcome, dear Rosencrant and Guildenstern.
    Moreoer that we much did long to see you,
    The need we hae to use you did prooke
    Our hasty sending. Something hae you heard
    Of Hamlets transformation. So I call it,
    Sith nor th eterior nor the inward man
    Resembles that it was. What it should be,
    More than his fathers death, that thus hath put him
    So much from th understanding of himself,
    I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
    That, being of so young clays brought up with him,
    And since so neighbourd to his youth and haiour,
    That you ouchsafe your rest here in our court
    Some little time so by your companies
    To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
    So much as from occasion you may glean,  
    Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
    That, opend, lies within our remedy.
  ueen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talkd of you,
    And sure I am two men there are not liing
    To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
    To show us so much gentry and good will
    As to epend your time with us awhile
    For the supply and profit of our hope,
    Your isitation shall receie such thanks
    As fits a kings remembrance.
  Ros. oth your Maesties
    Might, by the soereign power you hae of us,
    Put your dread pleasures more into command
    Than to entreaty.
  Guil. ut we both obey,
    And here gie up ourseles, in the full bent,
    To lay our serice freely at your feet,
    To be commanded.
  King. Thanks, Rosencrant and gentle Guildenstern.
  ueen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrant.  
    And I beseech you instantly to isit
    My too much changed son. Go, some of you,
    And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
  Guil. Heaens make our presence and our practices
    Pleasant and helpful to him
  ueen. Ay, amen
                 Eeunt Rosencrant and Guildenstern, with some
                                                    Attendants.

                         Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Th ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
    Are oyfully returnd.
  King. Thou still hast been the father of good news.
  Pol. Hae I, my lord Assure you, my good liege,
    I hold my duty as I hold my soul,
    oth to my God and to my gracious king
    And I do think or else this brain of mine
    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
    As it hath usd to do that I hae found  
    The ery cause of Hamlets lunacy.
  King. O, speak of that That do I long to hear.
  Pol. Gie first admittance to th ambassadors.
    My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
  King. Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
                                                Eit Polonius.
    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
    The head and source of all your sons distemper.
  ueen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
    His fathers death and our oerhasty marriage.
  King. Well, we shall sift him.

              Enter Polonius, oltemand, and Cornelius.

    Welcome, my good friends.
    Say, oltemand, what from our brother Norway
  olt. Most fair return of greetings and desires.
    pon our first, he sent out to suppress
    His nephews leies which to him appeard
    To be a preparation gainst the Polack,  
    ut better lookd into, he truly found
    It was against your Highness whereat gried,
    That so his sickness, age, and impotence
    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
    On Fortinbras which he, in brief, obeys,
    Receies rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
    Makes ow before his uncle neer more
    To gie th assay of arms against your Maesty.
    Whereon old Norway, oercome with oy,
    Gies him three thousand crowns in annual fee
    And his commission to employ those soldiers,
    So leied as before, against the Polack
    With an entreaty, herein further shown,
                                                Gies a paper.
    That it might please you to gie uiet pass
    Through your dominions for this enterprise,
    On such regards of safety and allowance
    As therein are set down.
  King. It likes us well
    And at our more considerd time well read,  
    Answer, and think upon this business.
    Meantime we thank you for your welltook labour.
    Go to your rest at night well feast together.
    Most welcome home                       Eeunt Ambassadors.
  Pol. This business is well ended.
    My liege, and madam, to epostulate
    What maesty should be, what duty is,
    Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
    Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
    Therefore, since breity is the soul of wit,
    And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
    I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.
    Mad call I it for, to define true madness,
    What ist but to be nothing else but mad
    ut let that go.
  ueen. More matter, with less art.
  Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
    That he is mad, tis true tis true tis pity
    And pity tis tis true. A foolish figure
    ut farewell it, for I will use no art.  
    Mad let us grant him then. And now remains
    That we find out the cause of this effect
    Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
    For this effect defectie comes by cause.
    Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
    Perpend.
    I hae a daughter hae while she is mine,
    Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
    Hath gien me this. Now gather, and surmise.
                                             Reads the letter.
    To the celestial, and my souls idol, the most beautified
      Ophelia,

    Thats an ill phrase, a ile phrase beautified is a ile
      phrase.
    ut you shall hear. Thus
                                                        Reads.
    In her ecellent white bosom, these, c.
  ueen. Came this from Hamlet to her
  Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.     Reads.  

          Doubt thou the stars are fire
            Doubt that the sun doth moe
          Doubt truth to be a liar
            ut neer doubt I loe.
      O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers I hae not art to
    reckon my groans but that I loe thee best, O most best, beliee
    it. Adieu.
      Thine eermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,
                                                          HAMLET.

    This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me
    And more aboe, hath his solicitings,
    As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
    All gien to mine ear.
  King. ut how hath she
    Receid his loe
  Pol. What do you think of me
  King. As of a man faithful and honourable.
  Pol. I would fain proe so. ut what might you think,  
    When I had seen this hot loe on the wing
    As I perceid it, I must tell you that,
    efore my daughter told me, what might you,
    Or my dear Maesty your ueen here, think,
    If I had playd the desk or table book,
    Or gien my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
    Or lookd upon this loe with idle sight
    What might you think No, I went round to work
    And my young mistress thus I did bespeak
    Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.
    This must not be. And then I prescripts gae her,
    That she should lock herself from his resort,
    Admit no messengers, receie no tokens.
    Which done, she took the fruits of my adice,
    And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
    Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
    Into the madness wherein now he raes,
    And all we mourn for.  
  King. Do you think tis this
  ueen. it may be, ery like.
  Pol. Hath there been such a time I would fain know that
    That I hae Positiely said Tis so,
    When it prod otherwise.
  King. Not that I know.
  Pol. points to his head and shoulder Take this from this, if this
      be otherwise.
    If circumstances lead me, I will find
    Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
    Within the centre.
  King. How may we try it further
  Pol. You know sometimes he walks four hours together
    Here in the lobby.
  ueen. So he does indeed.
  Pol. At such a time Ill loose my daughter to him.
    e you and I behind an arras then.
    Mark the encounter. If he loe her not,
    And he not from his reason falln thereon
    Let me be no assistant for a state,  
    ut keep a farm and carters.
  King. We will try it.

                 Enter Hamlet, reading on a book.

  ueen. ut look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
  Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away
    Ill board him presently. O, gie me leae.
                       Eeunt King and ueen, with Attendants.
    How does my good Lord Hamlet
  Ham. Well, Godamercy.
  Pol. Do you know me, my lord
  Ham. Ecellent well. You are a fishmonger.
  Pol. Not I, my lord.
  Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man.
  Pol. Honest, my lord
  Ham. Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man
    pickd out of ten thousand.
  Pol. Thats ery true, my lord.
  Ham. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god  
    kissing carrion Hae you a daughter
  Pol. I hae, my lord.
  Ham. Let her not walk i th sun. Conception is a blessing, but not
    as your daughter may conceie. Friend, look tot.
  Pol. aside How say you by that Still harping on my daughter. Yet
    he knew me not at first. He said I was a fishmonger. He is far
    gone, far gone And truly in my youth I suffred much etremity
    for loe ery near this. Ill speak to him again. What do you
    read, my lord
  Ham. Words, words, words.
  Pol. What is the matter, my lord
  Ham. etween who
  Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
  Ham. Slanders, sir for the satirical rogue says here that old men
    hae grey beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes
    purging thick amber and plumtree gum and that they hae a
    plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams. All which,
    sir, though I most powerfully and potently beliee, yet I hold it
    not honesty to hae it thus set down for you yourself, sir,
    should be old as I am if, like a crab, you could go backward.  
  Pol. aside Though this be madness, yet there is a method int.
   Will You walk out of the air, my lord
  Ham. Into my grae
  Pol. Indeed, that is out o th air. Aside How pregnant sometimes
    his replies are a happiness that often madness hits on, which
    reason and sanity could not so prosperously be deliered of. I
    will leae him and suddenly contrie the means of meeting between
    him and my daughter. My honourable lord, I will most humbly take
    my leae of you.
  Ham. You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
    willingly part withal ecept my life, ecept my life, ecept my
    life,

                    Enter Rosencrant and Guildenstern.

  Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
  Ham. These tedious old fools
  Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
  Ros. to Polonius God sae you, sir
                                                Eit Polonius.  
  Guil. My honourd lord
  Ros. My most dear lord
  Ham. My ecellent good friends How dost thou, Guildenstern Ah,
    Rosencrant Good lads, how do ye both
  Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth.
  Guil. Happy in that we are not oerhappy.
    On Fortunes cap we are not the ery button.
  Ham. Nor the soles of her shoe
  Ros. Neither, my lord.
  Ham. Then you lie about her waist, or in the middle of her
    faours
  Guil. Faith, her priates we.
  Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune O most true she is a
    strumpet. What news 
  Ros. None, my lord, but that the worlds grown honest.
  Ham. Then is doomsday near ut your news is not true. Let me
    uestion more in particular. What hae you, my good friends,
    desered at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison
    hither
  Guil. Prison, my lord  
  Ham. Denmarks a prison.
  Ros. Then is the world one.
  Ham. A goodly one in which there are many confines, wards, and
    dungeons, Denmark being one o th worst.
  Ros. We think not so, my lord.
  Ham. Why, then tis none to you for there is nothing either good
    or bad but thinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.
  Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. Tis too narrow for your
    mind.
  Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
    king of infinite space, were it not that I hae bad dreams.
  Guil. Which dreams indeed are ambition for the ery substance of
    the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
  Ham. A dream itself is but a shadow.
  Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a uality that
    it is but a shadows shadow.
  Ham. Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretchd
    heroes the beggars shadows. Shall we to th court for, by my
    fay, I cannot reason.
  oth. Well wait upon you.  
  Ham. No such matter I will not sort you with the rest of my
    serants for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most
    dreadfully attended. ut in the beaten way of friendship, what
    make you at Elsinore
  Ros. To isit you, my lord no other occasion.
  Ham. eggar that I am, I am een poor in thanks but I thank you
    and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were
    you not sent for Is it your own inclining Is it a free
    isitation Come, deal ustly with me. Come, come Nay, speak.
  Guil. What should we say, my lord
  Ham. Why, anything but to th purpose. You were sent for and
    there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties
    hae not craft enough to colour. I know the good King and ueen
    hae sent for you.
  Ros. To what end, my lord
  Ham. That you must teach me. ut let me conure you by the rights
    of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
    obligation of our eerpresered loe, and by what more dear a
    better proposer could charge you withal, be een and direct with
    me, whether you were sent for or no.  
  Ros. aside to Guildenstern What say you
  Ham. aside Nay then, I hae an eye of you. If you loe me, hold
    not off.
  Guil. My lord, we were sent for.
  Ham. I will tell you why. So shall my anticipation preent your
    discoery, and your secrecy to the King and ueen moult no
    feather. I hae of late but wherefore I know not lost all my
    mirth, forgone all custom of eercises and indeed, it goes so
    heaily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth,
    seems to me a sterile promontory this most ecellent canopy, the
    air, look you, this brae oerhanging firmament, this maestical
    roof fretted with golden fire why, it appeareth no other thing
    to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of apours. What a
    piece of work is a man how noble in reason how infinite in
    faculties in form and moing how epress and admirable in
    action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the
    beauty of the world, the paragon of animals And yet to me what
    is this uintessence of dust Man delights not me no, nor woman
    neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
  Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.  
  Ham. Why did you laugh then, when I said Man delights not me
  Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
    entertainment the players shall receie from you. We coted them
    on the way, and hither are they coming to offer you serice.
  Ham. He that plays the king shall be welcome his Maesty shall
    hae tribute of me the adenturous knight shall use his foil and
    target the loer shall not sigh gratis the humorous man shall
    end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose
    lungs are tickle o th sere and the lady shall say her mind
    freely, or the blank erse shall halt fort. What players are
    they
  Ros. Een those you were wont to take such delight in, the
    tragedians of the city.
  Ham. How chances it they trael Their residence, both in
    reputation and profit, was better both ways.
  Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
    innoation.
  Ham. Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the
    city Are they so followd
  Ros. No indeed are they not.  
  Ham. How comes it Do they grow rusty
  Ros. Nay, their endeaour keeps in the wonted pace but there is,
    sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top
    of uestion and are most tyrannically clappd fort. These are now
    the fashion, and so berattle the common stages so they call
    them that many wearing rapiers are afraid of gooseuills and
    dare scarce come thither.
  Ham. What, are they children Who maintains em How are they
    escoted Will they pursue the uality no longer than they can
    sing Will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
    themseles to common players as it is most like, if their means
    are no better, their writers do them wrong to make them eclaim
    against their own succession.
  Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides and the nation
    holds it no sin to tarre them to controersy. There was, for a
    while, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player
    went to cuffs in the uestion.
  Ham. Ist possible
  Guil. O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
  Ham. Do the boys carry it away  
  Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord Hercules and his load too.
  Ham. It is not ery strange for my uncle is King of Denmark, and
    those that would make mows at him while my father lied gie
    twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in
    little. Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if
    philosophy could find it out.

                     Flourish for the Players.

  Guil. There are the players.
  Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come Th
    appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply
    with you in this garb, lest my etent to the players which I
    tell you must show fairly outwards should more appear like
    entertainment than yours. You are welcome. ut my unclefather
    and auntmother are deceid.
  Guil. In what, my dear lord
  Ham. I am but mad northnorthwest. When the wind is southerly I
    know a hawk from a handsaw.
  
                            Enter Polonius.

  Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen
  Ham. Hark you, Guildenstern and you too at each ear a hearer
    That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
    clouts.
  Ros. Happily hes the second time come to them for they say an old
    man is twice a child.
  Ham. I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it.
   You say right, sir a Monday morning twas so indeed.
  Pol. My lord, I hae news to tell you.
  Ham. My lord, I hae news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in
    Rome
  Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
  Ham. u, bu
  Pol. pon my honour
  Ham. Then came each actor on his ass
  Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
    history, pastoral, pastoralcomical, historicalpastoral,
    tragicalhistorical, tragicalcomicalhistoricalpastoral scene  
    indiidable, or poem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heay, nor
    Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are
    the only men.
  Ham. O ephthah, udge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou
  Pol. What treasure had he, my lord
  Ham. Why,

         One fair daughter, and no more,
           The which he loed passing well.

  Pol. aside Still on my daughter.
  Ham. Am I not i th right, old ephthah
  Pol. If you call me ephthah, my lord, I hae a daughter that I
    loe passing well.
  Ham. Nay, that follows not.
  Pol. What follows then, my lord
  Ham. Why,

           As by lot, God wot,

 and then, you know,
  
           It came to pass, as most like it was.

    The first row of the pious chanson will show you more for look
    where my abridgment comes.

                     Enter four or fie Players.

    You are welcome, masters welcome, all. I am glad to see thee
    well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old friend Why, thy face is
    alancd since I saw thee last. Comst thou to beard me in
    Denmark What, my young lady and mistress yr Lady, your
    ladyship is nearer to heaen than when I saw you last by the
    altitude of a chopine. Pray God your oice, like a piece of
    uncurrent gold, be not crackd within the ring. Masters, you are
    all welcome. Well een tot like French falconers, fly at
    anything we see. Well hae a speech straight. Come, gie us a
    taste of your uality. Come, a passionate speech.
  1. Play. What speech, my good lord
  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was neer acted
    or if it was, not aboe once for the play, I remember, pleasd  
    not the million, twas caiary to the general but it was as I
    receid it, and others, whose udgments in such matters cried in
    the top of mine an ecellent play, well digested in the scenes,
    set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said
    there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter saoury,
    nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of
    affectation but calld it an honest method, as wholesome as
    sweet, and by ery much more handsome than fine. One speech int
    I chiefly lod. Twas AEneas tale to Dido, and thereabout of it
    especially where he speaks of Priams slaughter. If it lie in
    your memory, begin at this line let me see, let me see

         The rugged Pyrrhus, like th Hyrcanian beast

    Tis not so it begins with Pyrrhus

         The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
         lack as his purpose, did the night resemble
         When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
         Hath now this dread and black compleion smeard  
         With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
         Now is be total gules, horridly trickd
         With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
         akd and impasted with the parching streets,
         That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
         To their lords murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
         And thus oersied with coagulate gore,
         With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
         Old grandsire Priam seeks.

    So, proceed you.
  Pol. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
     discretion.

  1. Play. Anon he finds him,
      Striking too short at Greeks. His antiue sword,
      Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
      Repugnant to command. neual matchd,
      Pyrrhus at Priam dries, in rage strikes wide
      ut with the whiff and wind of his fell sword  
      Th unnered father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
      Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
      Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
      Takes prisoner Pyrrhus ear. For lo his sword,
      Which was declining on the milky head
      Of reerend Priam, seemd i th air to stick.
      So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
      And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
      Did nothing.
      ut, as we often see, against some storm,
      A silence in the heaens, the rack stand still,
      The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
      As hush as death anon the dreadful thunder
      Doth rend the region so, after Pyrrhus pause,
      Aroused engeance sets him new awork
      And neer did the Cyclops hammers fall
      On Marss armour, forgd for proof eterne,
      With less remorse than Pyrrhus bleeding sword
      Now falls on Priam.
      Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune All you gods,  
      In general synod take away her power
      reak all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
      And bowl the round nae down the hill of heaen,
      As low as to the fiends

  Pol. This is too long.
  Ham. It shall to the barbers, with your beard. Prithee say on.
    Hes for a ig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps. Say on come to
    Hecuba.

  1. Play. ut who, O who, had seen the mobled ueen

  Ham. The mobled ueen
  Pol. Thats good Mobled ueen is good.

  1. Play. Run barefoot up and down, threatning the flames
      With bisson rheum a clout upon that head
      Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
      About her lank and all oerteemed loins,
      A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up  
      Who this had seen, with tongue in enom steepd
      Gainst Fortunes state would treason hae pronouncd.
      ut if the gods themseles did see her then,
      When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
      In Mincing with his sword her husbands limbs,
      The instant burst of clamour that she made
      nless things mortal moe them not at all
      Would hae made milch the burning eyes of heaen
      And passion in the gods.

  Pol. Look, wher he has not turnd his colour, and has tears ins
    eyes. Prithee no more
  Ham. Tis well. Ill hae thee speak out the rest of this soon.
    Good my lord, will you see the players well bestowd Do you
    hear Let them be well usd for they are the abstract and brief
    chronicles of the time. After your death you were better hae a
    bad epitaph than their ill report while you lie.
  Pol. My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
  Ham. Gods bodykins, man, much better se eery man after his
    desert, and who should scape whipping se them after your own  
    honour and dignity. The less they desere, the more merit is in
    your bounty. Take them in.
  Pol. Come, sirs.
  Ham. Follow him, friends. Well hear a play tomorrow.
                 Eeunt Polonius and Players ecept the First.
    Dost thou hear me, old friend Can you play The Murther of
    Gonago
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Well hat tomorrow night. You could, for a need, study a
    speech of some doen or siteen lines which I would set down and
    insert int, could you not
  1. Play. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. ery well. Follow that lord and look you mock him not.
                                            Eit First Player.
    My good friends, Ill leae you till night. You are welcome to
    Elsinore.
  Ros. Good my lord
  Ham. Ay, so, God b wi ye
                            Eeunt Rosencrant and Guildenstern
    Now I am alone.  
    O what a rogue and peasant slae am I
    Is it not monstrous that this player here,
    ut in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
    Could force his soul so to his own conceit
    That, from her working, all his isage wannd,
    Tears in his eyes, distraction ins aspect,
    A broken oice, and his whole function suiting
    With forms to his conceit And all for nothing
    For Hecuba
    Whats Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
    That he should weep for her What would he do,
    Had he the motie and the cue for passion
    That I hae He would drown the stage with tears
    And cleae the general ear with horrid speech
    Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
    Confound the ignorant, and amae indeed
    The ery faculties of eyes and ears.
    Yet I,
    A dull and muddymettled rascal, peak
    Like ohnadreams, unpregnant of my cause,  
    And can say nothing No, not for a king,
    pon whose property and most dear life
    A damnd defeat was made. Am I a coward
    Who calls me illain breaks my pate across
    Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face
    Tweaks me by th nose gies me the lie i th throat
    As deep as to the lungs Who does me this, ha
    Swounds, I should take it for it cannot be
    ut I am pigeonlierd and lack gall
    To make oppression bitter, or ere this
    I should hae fatted all the region kites
    With this slaes offal. loody bawdy illain
    Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless illain
    O, engeance
    Why, what an ass am I This is most brae,
    That I, the son of a dear father murtherd,
    Prompted to my reenge by heaen and hell,
    Must like a whore unpack my heart with words
    And fall acursing like a ery drab,
    A scullion  
    Fie upont foh About, my brain Hum, I hae heard
    That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
    Hae by the ery cunning of the scene
    een struck so to the soul that presently
    They hae proclaimd their malefactions
    For murther, though it hae no tongue, will speak
    With most miraculous organ, Ill hae these Players
    Play something like the murther of my father
    efore mine uncle. Ill obsere his looks
    Ill tent him to the uick. If he but blench,
    I know my course. The spirit that I hae seen
    May be a deil and the deil hath power
    T assume a pleasing shape yea, and perhaps
    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
    As he is ery potent with such spirits,
    Abuses me to damn me. Ill hae grounds
    More relatie than this. The plays the thing
    Wherein Ill catch the conscience of the King.         Eit.





ACT III. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King, ueen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrant, Guildenstern, and Lords.

  King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
    Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
    Grating so harshly all his days of uiet
    With turbulent and dangerous lunacy
  Ros. He does confess he feels himself distracted,
    ut from what cause he will by no means speak.
  Guil. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
    ut with a crafty madness keeps aloof
    When we would bring him on to some confession
    Of his true state.
  ueen. Did he receie you well
  Ros. Most like a gentleman.
  Guil. ut with much forcing of his disposition.
  Ros. Niggard of uestion, but of our demands
    Most free in his reply.
  ueen. Did you assay him  
    To any pastime
  Ros. Madam, it so fell out that certain players
    We oerraught on the way. Of these we told him,
    And there did seem in him a kind of oy
    To hear of it. They are here about the court,
    And, as I think, they hae already order
    This night to play before him.
  Pol. Tis most true
    And he beseechd me to entreat your Maesties
    To hear and see the matter.
  King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
    To hear him so inclind.
    Good gentlemen, gie him a further edge
    And drie his purpose on to these delights.
  Ros. We shall, my lord.
                            Eeunt Rosencrant and Guildenstern.
  King. Sweet Gertrude, leae us too
    For we hae closely sent for Hamlet hither,
    That he, as twere by accident, may here
    Affront Ophelia.  
    Her father and myself lawful espials
    Will so bestow ourseles that, seeing unseen,
    We may of their encounter frankly udge
    And gather by him, as he is behad,
    Ift be th affliction of his loe, or no,
    That thus he suffers for.
  ueen. I shall obey you
    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
    That your good beauties be the happy cause
    Of Hamlets wildness. So shall I hope your irtues
    Will bring him to his wonted way again,
    To both your honours.
  Oph. Madam, I wish it may.
                                                   Eit ueen.
  Pol. Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,
    We will bestow ourseles. To Ophelia Read on this book,
    That show of such an eercise may colour
    Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,
    Tis too much prod, that with deotions isage
    And pious action we do sugar oer  
    The Deil himself.
  King. aside O, tis too true
    How smart a lash that speech doth gie my conscience
    The harlots cheek, beautied with plastring art,
    Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
    Than is my deed to my most painted word.
    O heay burthen
  Pol. I hear him coming. Lets withdraw, my lord.
                                      Eeunt King and Polonius.

                           Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. To be, or not to be that is the uestion
    Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
    And by opposing end them. To die to sleep
    No more and by a sleep to say we end
    The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is heir to. Tis a consummation  
    Deoutly to be wishd. To die to sleep.
    To sleep perchance to dream ay, theres the rub
    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
    When we hae shuffled off this mortal coil,
    Must gie us pause. Theres the respect
    That makes calamity of so long life.
    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
    Th oppressors wrong, the proud mans contumely,
    The pangs of despisd loe, the laws delay,
    The insolence of office, and the spurns
    That patient merit of th unworthy takes,
    When he himself might his uietus make
    With a bare bodkin Who would these fardels bear,
    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
    ut that the dread of something after death
    The undiscoerd country, from whose bourn
    No traeller returns pules the will,
    And makes us rather bear those ills we hae
    Than fly to others that we know not of
    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,  
    And thus the natie hue of resolution
    Is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought,
    And enterprises of great pith and moment
    With this regard their currents turn awry
    And lose the name of action. Soft you now
    The fair Ophelia Nymph, in thy orisons
    e all my sins remembred.
  Oph. Good my lord,
    How does your honour for this many a day
  Ham. I humbly thank you well, well, well.
  Oph. My lord, I hae remembrances of yours
    That I hae longed long to redelier.
    I pray you, now receie them.
  Ham. No, not I
    I neer gae you aught.
  Oph. My honourd lord, you know right well you did,
    And with them words of so sweet breath composd
    As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
    Take these again for to the noble mind
    Rich gifts wa poor when giers proe unkind.  
    There, my lord.
  Ham. Ha, ha Are you honest
  Oph. My lord
  Ham. Are you fair
  Oph. What means your lordship
  Ham. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no
    discourse to your beauty.
  Oph. Could beauty, my lord, hae better commerce than with honesty
  Ham. Ay, truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform
    honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can
    translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a parado,
    but now the time gies it proof. I did loe you once.
  Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me beliee so.
  Ham. You should not hae belied me for irtue cannot so
    inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loed you
    not.
  Oph. I was the more deceied.
  Ham. Get thee to a nunnery Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
    sinners I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse
    me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me.  
    I am ery proud, reengeful, ambitious with more offences at my
    beck than I hae thoughts to put them in, imagination to gie
    them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I
    do, crawling between earth and heaen We are arrant knaes all
    beliee none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Wheres your
    father
  Oph. At home, my lord.
  Ham. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
    nowhere but ins own house. Farewell.
  Oph. O, help him, you sweet heaens
  Ham. If thou dost marry, Ill gie thee this plague for thy dowry
    be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape
    calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
    needs marry, marry a fool for wise men know well enough what
    monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go and uickly too.
    Farewell.
  Oph. O heaenly powers, restore him
  Ham. I hae heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
    gien you one face, and you make yourseles another. You ig, you
    amble, and you lisp you nickname Gods creatures and make your  
    wantonness your ignorance. Go to, Ill no more ont it hath made
    me mad. I say, we will hae no moe marriages. Those that are
    married already all but one shall lie the rest shall keep as
    they are. To a nunnery, go.                            Eit.
  Oph. O, what a noble mind is here oerthrown
    The courtiers, scholars, soldiers, eye, tongue, sword,
    Th epectancy and rose of the fair state,
    The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
    Th obserd of all obserers uite, uite down
    And I, of ladies most deect and wretched,
    That suckd the honey of his music ows,
    Now see that noble and most soereign reason,
    Like sweet bells angled, out of tune and harsh
    That unmatchd form and feature of blown youth
    lasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
    T hae seen what I hae seen, see what I see

                   Enter King and Polonius.

  King. Loe his affections do not that way tend  
    Nor what he spake, though it lackd form a little,
    Was not like madness. Theres something in his soul
    Oer which his melancholy sits on brood
    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
    Will be some danger which for to preent,
    I hae in uick determination
    Thus set it down he shall with speed to England
    For the demand of our neglected tribute.
    Haply the seas, and countries different,
    With ariable obects, shall epel
    This somethingsettled matter in his heart,
    Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
    From fashion of himself. What think you ont
  Pol. It shall do well. ut yet do I beliee
    The origin and commencement of his grief
    Sprung from neglected loe. How now, Ophelia
    You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said.
    We heard it all. My lord, do as you please
    ut if you hold it fit, after the play
    Let his ueen mother all alone entreat him  
    To show his grief. Let her be round with him
    And Ill be placd so please you, in the ear
    Of all their conference. If she find him not,
    To England send him or confine him where
    Your wisdom best shall think.
  King. It shall be so.
    Madness in great ones must not unwatchd go.         Eeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.

  Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronouncd it to you,
    trippingly on the tongue. ut if you mouth it, as many of our
    players do, I had as lie the town crier spoke my lines. Nor do
    not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
    gently for in the ery torrent, tempest, and as I may say
    whirlwind of your passion, you must acuire and beget a
    temperance that may gie it smoothness. O, it offends me to the
    soul to hear a robustious periwigpated fellow tear a passion to
    tatters, to ery rags, to split the cars of the groundlings, who
    for the most part are capable of nothing but ineplicable dumb
    shows and noise. I would hae such a fellow whippd for oerdoing
    Termagant. It outherods Herod. Pray you aoid it.
  Player. I warrant your honour.
  Ham. e not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your
    tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action with
    this special obserance, that you oerstep not the modesty of
    nature for anything so oerdone is from the purpose of playing,  
    whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
    twere, the mirror up to nature to show irtue her own feature,
    scorn her own image, and the ery age and body of the time his
    form and pressure. Now this oerdone, or come tardy off, though
    it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the udicious
    griee the censure of the which one must in your allowance
    oerweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I
    hae seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly not to
    speak it profanely, that, neither haing the accent of
    Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, hae so
    strutted and bellowed that I hae thought some of Natures
    ourneymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated
    humanity so abominably.
  Player. I hope we hae reformd that indifferently with us, sir.
  Ham. O, reform it altogether And let those that play your clowns
    speak no more than is set down for them. For there be of them
    that will themseles laugh, to set on some uantity of barren
    spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some necessary
    uestion of the play be then to be considered. Thats illanous
    and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go  
    make you ready.
                                                 Eeunt Players.

            Enter Polonius, Rosencrant, and Guildenstern.

    How now, my lord Will the King hear this piece of work
  Pol. And the ueen too, and that presently.
  Ham. id the players make haste, Eit Polonius. Will you two
    help to hasten them
  oth. We will, my lord.                       Eeunt they two.
  Ham. What, ho, Horatio

                      Enter Horatio.

  Hor. Here, sweet lord, at your serice.
  Ham. Horatio, thou art een as ust a man
    As eer my conersation copd withal.
  Hor. O, my dear lord
  Ham. Nay, do not think I flatter
    For what adancement may I hope from thee,  
    That no reenue hast but thy good spirits
    To feed and clothe thee Why should the poor be flatterd
    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
    And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
    Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear
    Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
    And could of men distinguish, her election
    Hath scald thee for herself. For thou hast been
    As one, in suffring all, that suffers nothing
    A man that Fortunes buffets and rewards
    Hast taen with eual thanks and blest are those
    Whose blood and udgment are so well commingled
    That they are not a pipe for Fortunes finger
    To sound what stop she please. Gie me that man
    That is not passions slae, and I will wear him
    In my hearts core, ay, in my heart of heart,
    As I do thee. Something too much of this I
    There is a play tonight before the King.
    One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
    Which I hae told thee, of my fathers death.  
    I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
    Een with the ery comment of thy soul
    Obsere my uncle. If his occulted guilt
    Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
    It is a damned ghost that we hae seen,
    And my imaginations are as foul
    As ulcans stithy. Gie him heedful note
    For I mine eyes will riet to his face,
    And after we will both our udgments oin
    In censure of his seeming.
  Hor. Well, my lord.
    If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
    And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.

    Sound a flourish. Enter Trumpets and Kettledrums. Danish
    march. Enter King, ueen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrant,
      Guildenstern, and other Lords attendant, with the Guard
                       carrying torches.

  Ham. They are coming to the play. I must be idle.  
    Get you a place.
  King. How fares our cousin Hamlet
  Ham. Ecellent, i faith of the chameleons dish. I eat the air,
    promisecrammd. You cannot feed capons so.
  King. I hae nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These words are not
    mine.
  Ham. No, nor mine now. To Polonius My lord, you playd once
    i th uniersity, you say
  Pol. That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
  Ham. What did you enact
  Pol. I did enact ulius Caesar I was killd i th Capitol rutus
    killd me.
  Ham. It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. e
    the players ready.
  Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
  ueen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
  Ham. No, good mother. Heres metal more attractie.
  Pol. to the King O, ho do you mark that
  Ham. Lady, shall I lie in your lap
                                  Sits down at Ophelias feet.  
  Oph. No, my lord.
  Ham. I mean, my head upon your lap
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Do you think I meant country matters
  Oph. I think nothing, my lord.
  Ham. Thats a fair thought to lie between maids legs.
  Oph. What is, my lord
  Ham. Nothing.
  Oph. You are merry, my lord.
  Ham. Who, I
  Oph. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. O God, your only igmaker What should a man do but be merry
    For look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died
    within s two hours.
  Oph. Nay tis twice two months, my lord.
  Ham. So long Nay then, let the deil wear black, for Ill hae a
    suit of sables. O heaens die two months ago, and not forgotten
    yet Then theres hope a great mans memory may outlie his life
    half a year. ut, byr Lady, he must build churches then or else
    shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobbyhorse, whose  
    epitaph is For O, for O, the hobbyhorse is forgot

               Hautboys play. The dumb show enters.

    Enter a King and a ueen ery loingly the ueen embracing
    him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation
    unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her
    neck. He lays him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing
    him asleep, leaes him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
    crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleepers ears, and
    leaes him. The ueen returns, finds the King dead, and makes
    passionate action. The Poisoner with some three or four Mutes,
    comes in again, seem to condole with her. The dead body is
    carried away. The Poisoner wooes the ueen with gifts she
    seems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts
    his loe.
                                                         Eeunt.

  Oph. What means this, my lord
  Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho it means mischief.  
  Oph. elike this show imports the argument of the play.

                      Enter Prologue.

  Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep counsel
    theyll tell all.
  Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant
  Ham. Ay, or any show that youll show him. e not you ashamd to
    show, hell not shame to tell you what it means.
  Oph. You are naught, you are naught Ill mark the play.

    Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,
      Here stooping to your clemency,
      We beg your hearing patiently.                     Eit.

  Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring
  Oph. Tis brief, my lord.
  Ham. As womans loe.

              Enter two Players as King and ueen.  

    King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus cart gone round
      Neptunes salt wash and Tellus orbed ground,
      And thirty doed moons with borrowed sheen
      About the world hae times twele thirties been,
      Since loe our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
      nite comutual in most sacred bands.
    ueen. So many ourneys may the sun and moon
      Make us again count oer ere loe be done
      ut woe is me you are so sick of late,
      So far from cheer and from your former state.
      That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
      Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must
      For womens fear and loe holds uantity,
      In neither aught, or in etremity.
      Now what my loe is, proof hath made you know
      And as my loe is sid, my fear is so.
      Where loe is great, the littlest doubts are fear
      Where little fears grow great, great loe grows there.
    King. Faith, I must leae thee, loe, and shortly too  
      My operant powers their functions leae to do.
      And thou shalt lie in this fair world behind,
      Honourd, belod, and haply one as kind
      For husband shalt thou
    ueen. O, confound the rest
      Such loe must needs be treason in my breast.
      When second husband let me be accurst
      None wed the second but who killed the first.

  Ham. aside Wormwood, wormwood

    ueen. The instances that second marriage moe
      Are base respects of thrift, but none of loe.
      A second time I kill my husband dead
      When second husband kisses me in bed.
    King. I do beliee you think what now you speak
      ut what we do determine oft we break.
      Purpose is but the slae to memory,
      Of iolent birth, but poor alidity
      Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,  
      ut fill unshaken when they mellow be.
      Most necessary tis that we forget
      To pay ourseles what to ourseles is debt.
      What to ourseles in passion we propose,
      The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
      The iolence of either grief or oy
      Their own enactures with themseles destroy.
      Where oy most reels, grief doth most lament
      Grief oys, oy griees, on slender accident.
      This world is not for aye, nor tis not strange
      That een our loes should with our fortunes change
      For tis a uestion left us yet to proe,
      Whether loe lead fortune, or else fortune loe.
      The great man down, you mark his faourite flies,
      The poor adancd makes friends of enemies
      And hitherto doth loe on fortune tend,
      For who not needs shall neer lack a friend,
      And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
      Directly seasons him his enemy.
      ut, orderly to end where I begun,  
      Our wills and fates do so contrary run
      That our deices still are oerthrown
      Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
      So think thou wilt no second husband wed
      ut die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
    ueen. Nor earth to me gie food, nor heaen light,
      Sport and repose lock from me day and night,
      To desperation turn my trust and hope,
      An anchors cheer in prison be my scope,
      Each opposite that blanks the face of oy
      Meet what I would hae well, and it destroy,
      oth here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
      If, once a widow, eer I be wife

  Ham. If she should break it now

    King. Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leae me here awhile.
      My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
      The tedious day with sleep.
    ueen. Sleep rock thy brain,  
                                                    He sleeps.
      And neer come mischance between us twain
Eit.

  Ham. Madam, how like you this play
  ueen. The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
  Ham. O, but shell keep her word.
  King. Hae you heard the argument Is there no offence int
  Ham. No, no They do but est, poison in est no offence i th
    world.
  King. What do you call the play
  Ham. The Mousetrap. Marry, how Tropically. This play is the
    image of a murther done in ienna. Gonago is the dukes name
    his wife, aptista. You shall see anon. Tis a knaish piece of
    work but what o that Your Maesty, and we that hae free
    souls, it touches us not. Let the galld ade winch our withers
    are unwrung.

                         Enter Lucianus.
  
    This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
  Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
  Ham. I could interpret between you and your loe, if I could see
    the puppets dallying.
  Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
  Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
  Oph. Still better, and worse.
  Ham. So you must take your husbands. egin, murtherer. Po, leae
    thy damnable faces, and begin Come, the croaking raen doth
    bellow for reenge.

    Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing
      Confederate season, else no creature seeing
      Thou miture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
      With Hecates ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
      Thy natural magic and dire property
      On wholesome life usurp immediately.
                                   Pours the poison in his ears.

  Ham. He poisons him i th garden fors estate. His names Gonago.  
    The story is etant, and written in ery choice Italian. You
    shall see anon how the murtherer gets the loe of Gonagos wife.
  Oph. The King rises.
  Ham. What, frighted with false fire
  ueen. How fares my lord
  Pol. Gie oer the play.
  King. Gie me some light Away
  All. Lights, lights, lights
                              Eeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.
  Ham.   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
          The hart ungalled play
         For some must watch, while some must sleep
          Thus runs the world away.
    Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers if the rest of my
    fortunes turn Turk with mewith two Proincial roses on my rad
    shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir
  Hor. Half a share.
  Ham.   A whole one I
         For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
           This realm dismantled was  
         Of oe himself and now reigns here
           A ery, ery paock.
  Hor. You might hae rhymd.
  Ham. O good Horatio, Ill take the ghosts word for a thousand
    pound Didst perceie
  Hor. ery well, my lord.
  Ham. pon the talk of the poisoning
  Hor. I did ery well note him.
  Ham.   Aha Come, some music Come, the recorders
         For if the King like not the comedy,
         Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
    Come, some music

                Enter Rosencrant and Guildenstern.

  Guil. Good my lord, ouchsafe me a word with you.
  Ham. Sir, a whole history.
  Guil. The King, sir
  Ham. Ay, sir, what of him
  Guil. Is in his retirement, marellous distemperd.  
  Ham. With drink, sir
  Guil. No, my lord rather with choler.
  Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to
    the doctor for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps
    plunge him into far more choler.
  Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start
    not so wildly from my affair.
  Ham. I am tame, sir pronounce.
  Guil. The ueen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit
    hath sent me to you.
  Ham. You are welcome.
  Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed.
    If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do
    your mothers commandment if not, your pardon and my return
    shall be the end of my business.
  Ham. Sir, I cannot.
  Guil. What, my lord
  Ham. Make you a wholesome answer my wits diseasd. ut, sir, such
    answer is I can make, you shall command or rather, as you say,
    my mother. Therefore no more, but to the matter My mother, you  
    say
  Ros. Then thus she says your behaiour hath struck her into
    amaement and admiration.
  Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother ut is there no
    seuel at the heels of this mothers admiration Impart.
  Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.
  Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Hae you any
    further trade with us
  Ros. My lord, you once did loe me.
  Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers
  Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper You do surely
    bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs to
    your friend.
  Ham. Sir, I lack adancement.
  Ros. How can that be, when you hae the oice of the King himself
    for your succession in Denmark
  Ham. Ay, sir, but while the grass grows the proerb is something
    musty.

                     Enter the Players with recorders.  

    O, the recorders Let me see one. To withdraw with you why do
    you go about to recoer the wind of me, as if you would drie me
    into a toil
  Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my loe is too unmannerly.
  Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe
  Guil. My lord, I cannot.
  Ham. I pray you.
  Guil. eliee me, I cannot.
  Ham. I do beseech you.
  Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord.
  Ham. It is as easy as lying. Goern these entages with your
    fingers and thumbs, gie it breath with your mouth, and it will
    discourse most elouent music. Look you, these are the stops.
  Guil. ut these cannot I command to any uttrance of harmony. I
    hae not the skill.
  Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me You
    would play upon me you would seem to know my stops you would
    pluck out the heart of my mystery you would sound me from my
    lowest note to the top of my compass and there is much music,  
    ecellent oice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it
    speak. Sblood, do you think I am easier to be playd on than a
    pipe Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me,
    you cannot play upon me.

                        Enter Polonius.

    God bless you, sir
  Pol. My lord, the ueen would speak with you, and presently.
  Ham. Do you see yonder cloud thats almost in shape of a camel
  Pol. y th mass, and tis like a camel indeed.
  Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
  Pol. It is backd like a weasel.
  Ham. Or like a whale.
  Pol. ery like a whale.
  Ham. Then will I come to my mother byandby. They fool me to the
    top of my bent. I will come byandby.
  Pol. I will say so.                                      Eit.
  Ham. yandby is easily said. Leae me, friends.
                                        Eeunt all but Hamlet.  
    Tis now the ery witching time of night,
    When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
    Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood
    And do such bitter business as the day
    Would uake to look on. Soft now to my mother
    O heart, lose not thy nature let not eer
    The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
    Let me be cruel, not unnatural
    I will speak daggers to her, but use none.
    My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites
    How in my words someer she be shent,
    To gie them seals neer, my soul, consent             Eit.




Scene III.
A room in the Castle.

Enter King, Rosencrant, and Guildenstern.

  King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
    To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you
    I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
    And he to England shall along with you.
    The terms of our estate may not endure
    Haard so near us as doth hourly grow
    Out of his lunacies.
  Guil. We will ourseles proide.
    Most holy and religious fear it is
    To keep those many many bodies safe
    That lie and feed upon your Maesty.
  Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound
    With all the strength and armour of the mind
    To keep itself from noyance but much more
    That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests
    The lies of many. The cesse of maesty
    Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw  
    Whats near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
    Fid on the summit of the highest mount,
    To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
    Are mortisd and adoind which when it falls,
    Each small annement, petty conseuence,
    Attends the boistrous ruin. Neer alone
    Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
  King. Arm you, I pray you, to th, speedy oyage
    For we will fetters put upon this fear,
    Which now goes too freefooted.
  oth. We will haste us.
                                               Eeunt Gentlemen.

                   Enter Polonius.

  Pol. My lord, hes going to his mothers closet.
    ehind the arras Ill coney myself
    To hear the process. Ill warrant shell ta him home
    And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
    Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,  
    Since nature makes them partial, should oerhear
    The speech, of antage. Fare you well, my liege.
    Ill call upon you ere you go to bed
    And tell you what I know.
  King. Thanks, dear my lord.
                                                Eit Polonius.
    O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaen
    It hath the primal eldest curse upont,
    A brothers murther Pray can I not,
    Though inclination be as sharp as will.
    My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
    And, like a man to double business bound,
    I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
    And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
    Were thicker than itself with brothers blood,
    Is there not rain enough in the sweet heaens
    To wash it white as snow Whereto seres mercy
    ut to confront the isage of offence
    And whats in prayer but this twofold force,
    To be forestalled ere we come to fall,  
    Or pardond being down Then Ill look up
    My fault is past. ut, O, what form of prayer
    Can sere my turn Forgie me my foul murther
    That cannot be since I am still possessd
    Of those effects for which I did the murther
    My crown, mine own ambition, and my ueen.
    May one be pardond and retain th offence
    In the corrupted currents of this world
    Offences gilded hand may shoe by ustice,
    And oft tis seen the wicked prie itself
    uys out the law but tis not so aboe.
    There is no shuffling there the action lies
    In his true nature, and we ourseles compelld,
    Een to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
    To gie in eidence. What then What rests
    Try what repentance can. What can it not
    Yet what can it when one cannot repent
    O wretched state O bosom black as death
    O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
    Art more engagd Help, angels Make assay.  
    ow, stubborn knees and heart with strings of steel,
    e soft as sinews of the newborn babe
    All may be well.                                  He kneels.

                         Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying
    And now Ill dot. And so he goes to heaen,
    And so am I reengd. That would be scannd.
    A illain kills my father and for that,
    I, his sole son, do this same illain send
    To heaen.
    Why, this is hire and salary, not reenge
    He took my father grossly, full of bread,
    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May
    And how his audit stands, who knows sae heaen
    ut in our circumstance and course of thought,
    Tis heay with him and am I then reengd,
    To take him in the purging of his soul,
    When he is fit and seasoned for his passage  
    No.
    p, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.
    When he is drunk asleep or in his rage
    Or in th incestuous pleasure of his bed
    At gaming, swearing, or about some act
    That has no relish of salation int
    Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaen,
    And that his soul may be as damnd and black
    As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
    This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.              Eit.
  King. rises My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
    Words without thoughts neer to heaen go.             Eit.




Scene I.
The ueens closet.

Enter ueen and Polonius.

  Pol. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.
    Tell him his pranks hae been too broad to bear with,
    And that your Grace hath screend and stood between
    Much heat and him. Ill silence me een here.
    Pray you be round with him.
  Ham. within Mother, mother, mother
  ueen. Ill warrant you fear me not. Withdraw I hear him coming.
                              Polonius hides behind the arras.

                          Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Now, mother, whats the matter
  ueen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
  Ham. Mother, you hae my father much offended.
  ueen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
  Ham. Go, go, you uestion with a wicked tongue.
  ueen. Why, how now, Hamlet  
  Ham. Whats the matter now
  ueen. Hae you forgot me
  Ham. No, by the rood, not so
    You are the ueen, your husbands brothers wife,
    And would it were not so you are my mother.
  ueen. Nay, then Ill set those to you that can speak.
  Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge I
    You go not till I set you up a glass
    Where you may see the inmost part of you.
  ueen. What wilt thou do Thou wilt not murther me
    Help, help, ho
  Pol. behind What, ho help, help, help
  Ham. draws How now a rat Dead for a ducat, dead
            Makes a pass through the arras and kills Polonius.
  Pol. behind O, I am slain
  ueen. O me, what hast thou done
  Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King
  ueen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this
  Ham. A bloody deed almost as bad, good mother,
    As kill a king, and marry with his brother.  
  ueen. As kill a king
  Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
                         Lifts up the arras and sees Polonius.
    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell
    I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
    Thou findst to be too busy is some danger.
    Leae wringing of your hinds. Peace sit you down
    And let me wring your heart for so I shall
    If it be made of penetrable stuff
    If damned custom hae not brad it so
    That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
  ueen. What hae I done that thou darst wag thy tongue
    In noise so rude against me
  Ham. Such an act
    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty
    Calls irtue hypocrite takes off the rose
    From the fair forehead of an innocent loe,
    And sets a blister there makes marriage ows
    As false as dicers oaths. O, such a deed
    As from the body of contraction plucks  
    The ery soul, and sweet religion makes
    A rhapsody of words Heaens face doth glow
    Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
    With tristful isage, as against the doom,
    Is thoughtsick at the act.
  ueen. Ay me, what act,
    That roars so loud and thunders in the inde
  Ham. Look here upon ths picture, and on this,
    The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
    See what a grace was seated on this brow
    Hyperions curls the front of oe himself
    An eye like Mars, to threaten and command
    A station like the herald Mercury
    New lighted on a heaenkissing hill
    A combination and a form indeed
    Where eery god did seem to set his seal
    To gie the world assurance of a man.
    This was your husband. Look you now what follows.
    Here is your husband, like a mildewd ear
    lasting his wholesome brother. Hae you eyes  
    Could you on this fair mountain leae to feed,
    And batten on this moor Ha hae you eyes
    You cannot call it loe for at your age
    The heyday in the blood is tame, its humble,
    And waits upon the udgment and what udgment
    Would step from this to this Sense sure you hae,
    Else could you not hae motion but sure that sense
    Is apopled for madness would not err,
    Nor sense to ecstacy was neer so thralld
    ut it reserd some uantity of choice
    To sere in such a difference. What deil wast
    That thus hath coend you at hoodmanblind
    Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
    Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
    Or but a sickly part of one true sense
    Could not so mope.
    O shame where is thy blush Rebellious hell,
    If thou canst mutine in a matrons bones,
    To flaming youth let irtue be as wa
    And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame  
    When the compulsie ardour gies the charge,
    Since frost itself as actiely doth burn,
    And reason panders will.
  ueen. O Hamlet, speak no more
    Thou turnst mine eyes into my ery soul,
    And there I see such black and grained spots
    As will not leae their tinct.
  Ham. Nay, but to lie
    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
    Stewd in corruption, honeying and making loe
    Oer the nasty sty
  ueen. O, speak to me no more
    These words like daggers enter in mine ears.
    No more, sweet Hamlet
  Ham. A murtherer and a illain
    A slae that is not twentieth part the tithe
    Of your precedent lord a ice of kings
    A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
    And put it in his pocket  
  ueen. No more

                Enter the Ghost in his nightgown.

  Ham. A king of shreds and patches
    Sae me and hoer oer me with your wings,
    You heaenly guards What would your gracious figure
  ueen. Alas, hes mad
  Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
    That, lapsd in time and passion, lets go by
    Th important acting of your dread command
    O, say
  Ghost. Do not forget. This isitation
    Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
    ut look, amaement on thy mother sits.
    O, step between her and her fighting soul
    Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
    Speak to her, Hamlet.
  Ham. How is it with you, lady
  ueen. Alas, how ist with you,  
    That you do bend your eye on acancy,
    And with th encorporal air do hold discourse
    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep
    And, as the sleeping soldiers in th alarm,
    Your bedded hairs, like life in ecrements,
    Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
    pon the beat and flame of thy distemper
    Sprinkle cool patience Whereon do you look
  Ham. On him, on him Look you how pale he glares
    His form and cause conoind, preaching to stones,
    Would make them capable. Do not look upon me,
    Lest with this piteous action you conert
    My stern effects. Then what I hae to do
    Will want true colour tears perchance for blood.
  ueen. To whom do you speak this
  Ham. Do you see nothing there
  ueen. Nothing at all yet all that is I see.
  Ham. Nor did you nothing hear
  ueen. No, nothing but ourseles.
  Ham. Why, look you there Look how it steals away  
    My father, in his habit as he lid
    Look where he goes een now out at the portal
                                                     Eit Ghost.
  ueen. This is the ery coinage of your brain.
    This bodiless creation ecstasy
    Is ery cunning in.
  Ham. Ecstasy
    My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
    And makes as healthful music. It is not madness
    That I hae uttred. ring me to the test,
    And I the matter will reword which madness
    Would gambol from. Mother, for loe of grace,
    Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
    That not your trespass but my madness speaks.
    It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
    Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
    Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaen
    Repent whats past aoid what is to come
    And do not spread the compost on the weeds
    To make them ranker. Forgie me this my irtue  
    For in the fatness of these pursy times
    irtue itself of ice must pardon beg
    Yea, curb and woo for leae to do him good.
  ueen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
  Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,
    And lie the purer with the other half,
    Good night but go not to my uncles bed.
    Assume a irtue, if you hae it not.
    That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat
    Of habits eil, is angel yet in this,
    That to the use of actions fair and good
    He likewise gies a frock or liery,
    That aptly is put on. Refrain tonight,
    And that shall lend a kind of easiness
    To the net abstinence the net more easy
    For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
    And either master the deil, or throw him out
    With wondrous potency. Once more, good night
    And when you are desirous to be blest,
    Ill blessing beg of you. For this same lord,  
    I do repent but heaen hath pleasd it so,
    To punish me with this, and this with me,
    That I must be their scourge and minister.
    I will bestow him, and will answer well
    The death I gae him. So again, good night.
    I must be cruel, only to be kind
    Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
    One word more, good lady.
  ueen. What shall I do
  Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do
    Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed
    Pinch wanton on your cheek call you his mouse
    And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
    Or paddling in your neck with his damnd fingers,
    Make you to rael all this matter out,
    That I essentially am not in madness,
    ut mad in craft. Twere good you let him know
    For who thats but a ueen, fair, sober, wise,
    Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib
    Such dear concernings hide Who would do so  
    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
    npeg the basket on the houses top,
    Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
    To try conclusions, in the basket creep
    And break your own neck down.
  ueen. e thou assurd, if words be made of breath,
    And breath of life, I hae no life to breathe
    What thou hast said to me.
  Ham. I must to England you know that
  ueen. Alack,
    I had forgot Tis so concluded on.
  Ham. Theres letters seald and my two schoolfellows,
    Whom I will trust as I will adders fangd,
    They bear the mandate they must sweep my way
    And marshal me to knaery. Let it work
    For tis the sport to hae the enginer
    Hoist with his own petar and t shall go hard
    ut I will dele one yard below their mines
    And blow them at the moon. O, tis most sweet
    When in one line two crafts directly meet.  
    This man shall set me packing.
    Ill lug the guts into the neighbour room.
    Mother, good night. Indeed, this counsellor
    Is now most still, most secret, and most grae,
    Who was in life a foolish peating knae.
    Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
    Good night, mother.
                  Eit the ueen. Then Eit Hamlet, tugging in
                                                       Polonius.





ACT I. Scene I.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King and ueen, with Rosencrant and Guildenstern.

  King. Theres matter in these sighs. These profound heaes
    You must translate tis fit we understand them.
    Where is your son
  ueen. estow this place on us a little while.
                          Eeunt Rosencrant and Guildenstern.
    Ah, mine own lord, what hae I seen tonight
  King. What, Gertrude How does Hamlet
  ueen. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
    Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit
    ehind the arras hearing something stir,
    Whips out his rapier, cries A rat, a rat
    And in this brainish apprehension kills
    The unseen good old man.
  King. O heay deed
    It had been so with us, had we been there.
    His liberty is full of threats to all
    To you yourself, to us, to eery one.  
    Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answerd
    It will be laid to us, whose proidence
    Should hae kept short, restraind, and out of haunt
    This mad young man. ut so much was our loe
    We would not understand what was most fit,
    ut, like the owner of a foul disease,
    To keep it from diulging, let it feed
    Een on the pith of life. Where is he gone
  ueen. To draw apart the body he hath killd
    Oer whom his ery madness, like some ore
    Among a mineral of metals base,
    Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
  King. O Gertrude, come away
    The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
    ut we will ship him hence and this ile deed
    We must with all our maesty and skill
    oth countenance and ecuse. Ho, Guildenstern

             Enter Rosencrant and Guildenstern.
  
    Friends both, go oin you with some further aid.
    Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
    And from his mothers closet hath he draggd him.
    Go seek him out speak fair, and bring the body
    Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.
                          Eeunt Rosencrant and Guildenstern.
    Come, Gertrude, well call up our wisest friends
    And let them know both what we mean to do
    And whats untimely done. So haply slander
    Whose whisper oer the worlds diameter,
    As leel as the cannon to his blank,
    Transports his poisoned shot may miss our name
    And hit the woundless air. O, come away
    My soul is full of discord and dismay.
                                                         Eeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A passage in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet.

  Ham. Safely stowd.
  Gentlemen. within Hamlet Lord Hamlet
  Ham. ut soft What noise Who calls on Hamlet O, here they come.

               Enter Rosencrant and Guildenstern.

  Ros. What hae you done, my lord, with the dead body
  Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto tis kin.
  Ros. Tell us where tis, that we may take it thence
    And bear it to the chapel.
  Ham. Do not beliee it.
  Ros. eliee what
  Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. esides, to be
    demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the son
    of a king
  Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord
  Ham. Ay, sir that soaks up the Kings countenance, his rewards,  
    his authorities. ut such officers do the King best serice in
    the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his aw
    first mouthd, to be last Swallowed. When he needs what you hae
    gleand, it is but sueeing you and, sponge, you shall be dry
    again.
  Ros. I understand you not, my lord.
  Ham. I am glad of it. A knaish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
  Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to
    the King.
  Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body.
    The King is a thing
  Guil. A thing, my lord
  Ham. Of nothing. ring me to him. Hide fo, and all after.
                                                         Eeunt.




Scene III.
Elsinore. A room in the Castle.

Enter King.

  King. I hae sent to seek him and to find the body.
    How dangerous is it that this man goes loose
    Yet must not we put the strong law on him.
    Hes lod of the distracted multitude,
    Who like not in their udgment, but their eyes
    And where tis so, th offenders scourge is weighd,
    ut neer the offence. To bear all smooth and een,
    This sudden sending him away must seem
    Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
    y desperate appliance are relied,
    Or not at all.

                    Enter Rosencrant.

    How now O What hath befalln
  Ros. Where the dead body is bestowd, my lord,
    We cannot get from him.  
  King. ut where is he
  Ros. Without, my lord guarded, to know your pleasure.
  King. ring him before us.
  Ros. Ho, Guildenstern ring in my lord.

        Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern with Attendants.

  King. Now, Hamlet, wheres Polonius
  Ham. At supper.
  King. At supper Where
  Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
    conocation of politic worms are een at him. Your worm is your
    only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us, and
    we fat ourseles for maggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar
    is but ariable serice two dishes, but to one table. Thats the
    end.
  King. Alas, alas
  Ham. A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat
    of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
  King. What dost thou mean by this  
  Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through
    the guts of a beggar.
  King. Where is Polonius
  Ham. In heaen. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not
    there, seek him i th other place yourself. ut indeed, if you
    find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up
    the stair, into the lobby.
  King. Go seek him there. To Attendants.
  Ham. He will stay till you come.
                                            Eeunt Attendants.
  King. Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,
    Which we do tender as we dearly griee
    For that which thou hast done, must send thee hence
    With fiery uickness. Therefore prepare thyself.
    The bark is ready and the wind at help,
    Th associates tend, and eerything is bent
    For England.
  Ham. For England
  King. Ay, Hamlet.
  Ham. Good.  
  King. So is it, if thou knewst our purposes.
  Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. ut come, for England
    Farewell, dear mother.
  King. Thy loing father, Hamlet.
  Ham. My mother Father and mother is man and wife man and wife is
    one flesh and so, my mother. Come, for England
Eit.
  King. Follow him at foot tempt him with speed aboard.
    Delay it not Ill hae him hence tonight.
    Away for eerything is seald and done
    That else leans on th affair. Pray you make haste.
                            Eeunt Rosencrant and Guildenstern
    And, England, if my loe thou holdst at aught,
    As my great power thereof may gie thee sense,
    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
    After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
    Pays homage to us, thou mayst not coldly set
    Our soereign process, which imports at full,
    y letters congruing to that effect,
    The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England  
    For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
    And thou must cure me. Till I know tis done,
    Howeer my haps, my oys were neer begun.             Eit.





Scene I.
Near Elsinore.

Enter Fortinbras with his Army oer the stage.

  For. Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.
    Tell him that by his license Fortinbras
    Craes the coneyance of a promisd march
    Oer his kingdom. You know the rendeous.
    if that his Maesty would aught with us,
    We shall epress our duty in his eye
    And let him know so.
  Capt. I will dot, my lord.
  For. Go softly on.
                                   Eeunt all but the Captain.

       Enter Hamlet, Rosencrant, Guildenstern, and others.

  Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these
  Capt. They are of Norway, sir.
  Ham. How purposd, sir, I pray you
  Capt. Against some part of Poland.  
  Ham. Who commands them, sir
  Capt. The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
  Ham. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
    Or for some frontier
  Capt. Truly to speak, and with no addition,
    We go to gain a little patch of ground
    That hath in it no profit but the name.
    To pay fie ducats, fie, I would not farm it
    Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
    A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
  Ham. Why, then the Polack neer will defend it.
  Capt. Yes, it is already garrisond.
  Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
    Will not debate the uestion of this straw.
    This is th imposthume of much wealth and peace,
    That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
    Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.
  Capt. God b wi you, sir.                             Eit.
  Ros. Willt please you go, my lord
  Ham. Ill be with you straight. Go a little before.  
                                        Eeunt all but Hamlet.
    How all occasions do inform against me
    And spur my dull reenge What is a man,
    If his chief good and market of his time
    e but to sleep and feed A beast, no more.
    Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
    Looking before and after, gae us not
    That capability and godlike reason
    To fust in us unusd. Now, whether it be
    estial obliion, or some craen scruple
    Of thinking too precisely on th eent,
    A thought which, uarterd, hath but one part wisdom
    And eer three parts coward, I do not know
    Why yet I lie to say This things to do,
    Sith I hae cause, and will, and strength, and means
    To dot. Eamples gross as earth ehort me.
    Witness this army of such mass and charge,
    Led by a delicate and tender prince,
    Whose spirit, with diine ambition puffd,
    Makes mouths at the inisible eent,  
    Eposing what is mortal and unsure
    To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
    Een for an eggshell. Rightly to be great
    Is not to stir without great argument,
    ut greatly to find uarrel in a straw
    When honours at the stake. How stand I then,
    That hae a father kllld, a mother staind,
    Ecitements of my reason and my blood,
    And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
    The imminent death of twenty thousand men
    That for a fantasy and trick of fame
    Go to their graes like beds, fight for a plot
    Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
    Which is not tomb enough and continent
    To hide the slain O, from this time forth,
    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth            Eit.

  Gent. She speaks much of her father says she hears
    Theres tricks i th world, and hems, and beats her heart
    Spurns eniously at straws speaks things in doubt,
    That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
    Yet the unshaped use of it doth moe
    The hearers to collection they aim at it,
    And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts
    Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
    Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
    Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
  Hor. Twere good she were spoken with for she may strew
    Dangerous conectures in illbreeding minds.
  ueen. Let her come in.

    Aside To my sick soul as sins true nature is
    Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss.
    So full of artless ealousy is guilt
    It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

  King. How long hath she been thus

    My brother shall know of it and so I thank you for your good
    counsel. Come, my coach Good night, ladies. Good night, sweet
    ladies. Good night, good night.                         Eit
  King. Follow her close gie her good watch, I pray you.
                                                 Eit Horatio.  
    O, this is the poison of deep grief it springs
    All from her fathers death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
    When sorrows come, they come not single spies.
    ut in battalions First, her father slain
    Net, Your son gone, and he most iolent author
    Of his own ust remoe the people muddied,
    Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
    For good Polonius death, and we hae done but greenly
    In huggermugger to inter him Poor Ophelia
    Diided from herself and her fairudgment,
    Without the which we are Pictures or mere beasts
    Last, and as such containing as all these,
    Her brother is in secret come from France
    And wants not buers to infect his ear
    Feeds on his wonder, keep, himself in clouds,
    With pestilent speeches of his fathers death,
    Wherein necessity, of matter beggard,
    Will nothing stick Our person to arraign
    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
    Like to a murdring piece, in many places  
    Gie, me superfluous death.                  A noise within.
  ueen. Alack, what noise is this
  King. Where are my Switers Let them guard the door.

                     Enter a Messenger.

    What is the matter
  Mess. Sae Yourself, my lord
    The ocean, oerpeering of his list,
    Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
    Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,
    Oerbears Your offices. The rabble call him lord
    And, as the world were now but to begin,
    Antiuity forgot, custom not known,
    The ratifiers and props of eery word,
    They cry Choose we Laertes shall be king
    Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
    Laertes shall be king Laertes king
                                                 A noise within.
  ueen. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry  
    O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs
  King. The doors are broke.

                    Enter Laertes with others.

  Laer. Where is this king Sirs, staid you all without.
  All. No, lets come in
  Laer. I pray you gie me leae.
  All. We will, we will
  Laer. I thank you. Keep the door.      Eeunt his Followers.
    O thou ile king,
    Gie me my father
  ueen. Calmly, good Laertes.
  Laer. That drop of blood thats calm proclaims me bastard
    Cries cuckold to my father brands the harlot
    Een here between the chaste unsmirched brows
    Of my true mother.
  King. What is the cause, Laertes,
    That thy rebellion looks so giantlike
    Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.  
    Theres such diinity doth hedge a king
    That treason can but peep to what it would,
    Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
    Why thou art thus incensd. Let him go, Gertrude.
    Speak, man.
  Laer. Where is my father
  King. Dead.
  ueen. ut not by him
  King. Let him demand his fill.
  Laer. How came he dead Ill not be uggled with
    To hell, allegiance ows, to the blackest deil
    Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit
    I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
    That both the world, I gie to negligence,
    Let come what comes only Ill be reengd
    Most throughly for my father.
  King. Who shall stay you
  Laer. My will, not all the world
    And for my means, Ill husband them so well
    They shall go far with little.  
  King. Good Laertes,
    If you desire to know the certainty
    Of your dear fathers death, ist writ in Your reenge
    That swoopstake you will draw both friend and foe,
    Winner and loser
  Laer. None but his enemies.
  King. Will you know them then
  Laer. To his good friends thus wide Ill ope my arms
    And, like the kind liferendring pelican,
    Repast them with my blood.
  King. Why, now You speak
    Like a good child and a true gentleman.
    That I am guiltless of your fathers death,
    And am most sensibly in grief for it,
    It shall as leel to your udgment pierce
    As day does to your eye.
                              A noise within Let her come in.
  Laer. How now What noise is that

                      Enter Ophelia.  

    O heat, dry up my brains Tears seen times salt
    urn out the sense and irtue of mine eye
    y heaen, thy madness shall be paid by weight
    Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May
    Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia
    O heaens ist possible a young maids wits
    Should be as mortal as an old mans life
    Nature is fine in loe, and where tis fine,
    It sends some precious instance of itself
    After the thing it loes.

  Oph. sings
         They bore him barefacd on the bier
           Hey non nony, nony, hey nony
         And in his grae raind many a tear.

    Fare you well, my doe
  Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade reenge,
    It could not moe thus.  
  Oph. You must sing Adown adown, and you call him adowna. O,
    how the wheel becomes it It is the false steward, that stole his
    masters daughter.
  Laer. This nothings more than matter.
  Oph. Theres rosemary, thats for remembrance. Pray you, loe,
    remember. And there is pansies, thats for thoughts.
  Laer. A document in madness Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
  Oph. Theres fennel for you, and columbines. Theres rue for you,
    and heres some for me. We may call it herb of grace o Sundays.
    O, you must wear your rue with a difference Theres a daisy. I
    would gie you some iolets, but they witherd all when my father
    died. They say he made a good end.

    Sings For bonny sweet Robin is all my oy.

  Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
    She turns to faour and to prettiness.
  Oph. sings
         And will he not come again
         And will he not come again
           No, no, he is dead  
           Go to thy deathbed
         He neer will come again.

         His beard was as white as snow,
         All flaen was his poll.
           He is gone, he is gone,
           And we cast away moan.
         God amercy on his soul

    And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b wi, you.
Eit.
  Laer. Do you see this, O God
  King. Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
    Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
    Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
    And they shall hear and udge twit you and me.
    If by direct or by collateral hand
    They find us touchd, we will our kingdom gie,
    Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
    To you in satisfaction but if not,  
    e you content to lend your patience to us,
    And we shall ointly labour with your soul
    To gie it due content.
  Laer. Let this be so.
    His means of death, his obscure funeral
    No trophy, sword, nor hatchment oer his bones,
    No noble rite nor formal ostentation,
    Cry to be heard, as twere from heaen to earth,
    That I must callt in uestion.
  King. So you shall
    And where th offence is let the great ae fall.
    I pray you go with me.
                                                          Eeunt





Scene I.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter Horatio with an Attendant.

  Hor. What are they that would speak with me
  Serant. Seafaring men, sir. They say they hae letters for you.
  Hor. Let them come in.
                                               Eit Attendant.
    I do not know from what part of the world
    I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.

                          Enter Sailors.

  Sailor. God bless you, sir.
  Hor. Let him bless thee too.
  Sailor. A shall, sir, ant please him. Theres a letter for you,
    sir, it comes from th ambassador that was bound for England if
    your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.
  Hor. reads the letter Horatio, when thou shalt hae oerlookd
    this, gie these fellows some means to the King. They hae
    letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of  
    ery warlike appointment gae us chase. Finding ourseles too
    slow of sail, we put on a compelled alour, and in the grapple I
    boarded them. On the instant they got clear of our ship so I
    alone became their prisoner. They hae dealt with me like thiees
    of mercy but they knew what they did I am to do a good turn for
    them. Let the King hae the letters I hae sent, and repair thou
    to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I hae words
    to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb yet are they much too
    light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring
    thee where I am. Rosencrant and Guildenstern hold their course
    for England. Of them I hae much to tell thee. Farewell.
                            He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.

    Come, I will gie you way for these your letters,
    And dot the speedier that you may direct me
    To him from whom you brought them.                   Eeunt.





Scene II.
Elsinore. Another room in the Castle.

Enter King and Laertes.

  King. Now must your conscience my acuittance seal,
    And You must put me in your heart for friend,
    Sith you hae heard, and with a knowing ear,
    That he which hath your noble father slain
    Pursued my life.
  Laer. It well appears. ut tell me
    Why you proceeded not against these feats
    So crimeful and so capital in nature,
    As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
    You mainly were stirrd up.
  King. O, for two special reasons,
    Which may to you, perhaps, seein much unsinewd,
    ut yet to me they are strong. The ueen his mother
    Lies almost by his looks and for myself,
    My irtue or my plague, be it either which,
    Shes so conunctie to my life and soul
    That, as the star moes not but in his sphere,  
    I could not but by her. The other motie
    Why to a public count I might not go
    Is the great loe the general gender bear him,
    Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
    Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
    Conert his gies to graces so that my arrows,
    Too slightly timberd for so loud a wind,
    Would hae reerted to my bow again,
    And not where I had aimd them.
  Laer. And so hae I a noble father lost
    A sister drien into desprate terms,
    Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
    Stood challenger on mount of all the age
    For her perfections. ut my reenge will come.
  King. reak not your sleeps for that. You must not think
    That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
    That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
    And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
    I lod your father, and we loe ourself,
    And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine  

                 Enter a Messenger with letters.

    How now What news
  Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet
    This to your Maesty this to the ueen.
  King. From Hamlet Who brought them
  Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say I saw them not.
    They were gien me by Claudio he receid them
    Of him that brought them.
  King. Laertes, you shall hear them.
    Leae us.
                                                 Eit Messenger.
    ReadsHigh and Mighty,You shall know I am set naked on your
    kingdom. Tomorrow shall I beg leae to see your kingly eyes
    when I shall first asking your pardon thereunto recount the
    occasion of my sudden and more strange return.
                                                     HAMLET.
    What should this mean Are all the rest come back
    Or is it some abuse, and no such thing  
  Laer. Know you the hand
  King. Tis Hamlets character. Naked
    And in a postscript here, he says alone.
    Can you adise me
  Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. ut let him come
    It warms the ery sickness in my heart
    That I shall lie and tell him to his teeth,
    Thus didest thou.
  King. If it be so, Laertes
    As how should it be so how otherwise,
    Will you be ruld by me
  Laer. Ay my lord,
    So you will not oerrule me to a peace.
  King. To thine own peace. If he be now returnd
    As checking at his oyage, and that he means
    No more to undertake it, I will work him
    To eploit now ripe in my deice,
    nder the which he shall not choose but fall
    And for his death no wind
    ut een his mother shall uncharge the practice  
    And call it accident.
  Laer. My lord, I will be ruld
    The rather, if you could deise it so
    That I might be the organ.
  King. It falls right.
    You hae been talkd of since your trael much,
    And that in Hamlets hearing, for a uality
    Wherein they say you shine, Your sun of parts
    Did not together pluck such eny from him
    As did that one and that, in my regard,
    Of the unworthiest siege.
  Laer. What part is that, my lord
  King. A ery riband in the cap of youth
    Yet needfull too for youth no less becomes
    The light and careless liery that it wears
    Thin settled age his sables and his weeds,
    Importing health and graeness. Two months since
    Here was a gentleman of Normandy.
    I hae seen myself, and serd against, the French,
    And they can well on horseback but this gallant  
    Had witchcraft int. He grew unto his seat,
    And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
    As had he been incorpsd and deminaturd
    With the brae beast. So far he toppd my thought
    That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
    Come short of what he did.
  Laer. A Norman wast
  King. A Norman.
  Laer. pon my life, Lamound.
  King. The ery same.
  Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed
    And gem of all the nation.
  King. He made confession of you
    And gae you such a masterly report
    For art and eercise in your defence,
    And for your rapier most especially,
    That he cried out twould be a sight indeed
    If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation
    He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
    If you opposd them. Sir, this report of his  
    Did Hamlet so enenom with his eny
    That he could nothing do but wish and beg
    Your sudden coming oer to play with you.
    Now, out of this
  Laer. What out of this, my lord
  King. Laertes, was your father dear to you
    Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
    A face without a heart,
  Laer. Why ask you this
  King. Not that I think you did not loe your father
    ut that I know loe is begun by time,
    And that I see, in passages of proof,
    Time ualifies the spark and fire of it.
    There lies within the ery flame of loe
    A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it
    And nothing is at a like goodness still
    For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
    Dies in his own toomuch. That we would do,
    We should do when we would for this would changes,
    And hath abatements and delays as many  
    As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents
    And then this should is like a spendthrift sigh,
    That hurts by easing. ut to the uick o th ulcer
    Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake
    To show yourself your fathers son in deed
    More than in words
  Laer. To cut his throat i th church
  King. No place indeed should murther sanctuarie
    Reenge should hae no bounds. ut, good Laertes,
    Will you do this Keep close within your chamber.
    Will returnd shall know you are come home.
    Well put on those shall praise your ecellence
    And set a double arnish on the fame
    The Frenchman gae you bring you in fine together
    And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
    Most generous, and free from all contriing,
    Will not peruse the foils so that with ease,
    Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
    A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
    Reuite him for your father.  
  Laer. I will dot
    And for that purpose Ill anoint my sword.
    I bought an unction of a mountebank,
    So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
    Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
    Collected from all simples that hae irtue
    nder the moon, can sae the thing from death
    This is but scratchd withal. Ill touch my point
    With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
    It may be death.
  King. Lets further think of this,
    Weigh what conenience both of time and means
    May fit us to our shape. If this should fall,
    And that our drift look through our bad performance.
    Twere better not assayd. Therefore this proect
    Should hae a back or second, that might hold
    If this did blast in proof. Soft let me see.
    Well make a solemn wager on your cunnings
    I hat
    When in your motion you are hot and dry  
    As make your bouts more iolent to that end
    And that he calls for drink, Ill hae prepard him
    A chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping,
    If he by chance escape your enomd stuck,
    Our purpose may hold there. ut stay, what noise,

                           Enter ueen.

    How now, sweet ueen
  ueen. One woe doth tread upon anothers heel,
    So fast they follow. Your sisters drownd, Laertes.
  Laer. Drownd O, where
  ueen. There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
    That shows his hoar leaes in the glassy stream.
    There with fantastic garlands did she come
    Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
    That liberal shepherds gie a grosser name,
    ut our cold maids do dead mens fingers call them.
    There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
    Clambring to hang, an enious slier broke,  
    When down her weedy trophies and herself
    Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide
    And, mermaidlike, awhile they bore her up
    Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
    As one incapable of her own distress,
    Or like a creature natie and indued
    nto that element but long it could not be
    Till that her garments, heay with their drink,
    Pulld the poor wretch from her melodious lay
    To muddy death.
  Laer. Alas, then she is drownd
  ueen. Drownd, drownd.
  Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
    And therefore I forbid my tears but yet
    It is our trick nature her custom holds,
    Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
    The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
    I hae a speech of fire, that fain would blae
    ut that this folly douts it.                          Eit.
  King. Lets follow, Gertrude.  
    How much I had to do to calm his rage I
    Now fear I this will gie it start again
    Therefore lets follow.
                                                         Eeunt.

Enter two Clowns, with spades and pickaes.

  Clown. Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she wilfully
    seeks her own salation
  Other. I tell thee she is therefore make her grae straight.
    The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial.
  Clown. How can that be, unless she drownd herself in her own
    defence
  Other. Why, tis found so.
  Clown. It must be se offendendo it cannot be else. For here lies
    the point if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act and an
    act hath three branchesit is to act, to do, and to perform
    argal, she drownd herself wittingly.
  Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Deler
  Clown. Gie me leae. Here lies the water good. Here stands the
    man good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it is,
    will he nill he, he goes mark you that. ut if the water come to
    him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is not
    guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.  
  Other. ut is this law
  Clown. Ay, marry, ist crowners uest law.
  Other. Will you ha the truth ant If this had not been a
    gentlewoman, she should hae been buried out o Christian burial.
  Clown. Why, there thou sayst And the more pity that great folk
    should hae countnance in this world to drown or hang themseles
    more than their eenChristen. Come, my spade There is no
    ancient gentlemen but gardners, ditchers, and graemakers. They
    hold up Adams profession.
  Other. Was he a gentleman
  Clown. A was the first that eer bore arms.
  Other. Why, he had none.
  Clown. What, art a heathen How dost thou understand the Scripture
    The Scripture says Adam diggd. Could he dig without arms Ill
    put another uestion to thee. If thou answerest me not to the
    purpose, confess thyself
  Other. Go to
  Clown. What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the
    shipwright, or the carpenter
  Other. The gallowsmaker for that frame outlies a thousand  
    tenants.
  Clown. I like thy wit well, in good faith. The gallows does well.
    ut how does it well It does well to those that do ill. Now,
    thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the
    church. Argal, the gallows may do well to thee. Tot again, come
  Other. Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a
    carpenter
  Clown. Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
  Other. Marry, now I can tell
  Clown. Tot.
  Other. Mass, I cannot tell.

                 Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off.

  Clown. Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will
    not mend his pace with beating and when you are askd this
    uestion net, say a graemaker. The houses he makes lasts
    till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan fetch me a stoup of
    liuor.
                                            Eit Second Clown.  

                       Clown digs and sings.

       In youth when I did loe, did loe,
         Methought it was ery sweet
       To contract O the time for a my behoe,
         O, methought there a was nothing a meet.

  Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at
    graemaking
  Hor. Custom hath made it in him a Property of easiness.
  Ham. Tis een so. The hand of little employment hath the daintier
    sense.
  Clown. sings
         ut age with his stealing steps
           Hath clawed me in his clutch,

           As if I had neer been such.
                                            Throws up a skull.
  
  Ham. That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How the
    knae owls it to the ground,as if twere Cains awbone, that
    did the first murther This might be the pate of a Politician,
    which this ass now oerreaches one that would circument God,
    might it not
  Hor. It might, my lord.
  Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say Good morrow, sweet lord
    How dost thou, good lord This might be my Lord Suchaone, that
    praisd my Lord Suchaones horse when he meant to beg it might
    it not
  Hor. Ay, my lord.
  Ham. Why, een so and now my Lady Worms, chapless, and knockd
    about the maard with a setons spade. Heres fine reolution,
    and we had the trick to seet. Did these bones cost no more the
    breeding but to play at loggets with em Mine ache to think
    ont.

                                      Throws up another skull.

  Ham. Theres another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer
    Where be his uiddits now, his uillets, his cases, his tenures,
    and his tricks Why does he suffer this rude knae now to knock
    him about the sconce with a dirty shoel, and will not tell him
    of his action of battery Hum This fellow might be ins time a
    great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recogniances, his
    fines, his double ouchers, his recoeries. Is this the fine of
    his fines, and the recoery of his recoeries, to hae his fine
    pate full of fine dirt Will his ouchers ouch him no more of
    his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth
    of a pair of indentures The ery coneyances of his lands will
    scarcely lie in this bo and must th inheritor himself hae no
    more, ha
  Hor. Not a ot more, my lord.
  Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins
  Hor. Ay, my lord, And of caleskins too.
  Ham. They are sheep and cales which seek out assurance in that. I  
    will speak to this fellow. Whose graes this, sirrah
  Clown. Mine, sir.

    Sings O, a pit of clay for to be made
              For such a guest is meet.

  Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest int.
  Clown. You lie out ont, sir, and therefore tis not yours.
    For my part, I do not lie int, yet it is mine.
  Ham. Thou dost lie int, to be int and say it is thine. Tis for
    the dead, not for the uick therefore thou liest.
  Clown. Tis a uick lie, sir twill away again from me to you.
  Ham. What man dost thou dig it for
  Clown. For no man, sir.
  Ham. What woman then
  Clown. For none neither.
  Ham. Who is to be buried int
  Clown. One that was a woman, sir but, rest her soul, shes dead.
  Ham. How absolute the knae is We must speak by the card, or
    euiocation will undo us. y the Lord, Horatio, this three years
    I hae taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the toe  
    of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls
    his kibe. How long hast thou been a graemaker
  Clown. Of all the days i th year, I came tot that day that our
    last king Hamlet oercame Fortinbras.
  Ham. How long is that since
  Clown. Cannot you tell that Eery fool can tell that. It was the
    ery day that young Hamlet was born he that is mad, and sent
    into England.
  Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into England
  Clown. Why, because a was mad. A shall recoer his wits there
    or, if a do not, tis no great matter there.
  Ham. Why
  Clown. Twill not he seen in him there. There the men are as mad as
    he.
  Ham. How came he mad
  Clown. ery strangely, they say.
  Ham. How strangely
  Clown. Faith, een with losing his wits.
  Ham. pon what ground
  Clown. Why, here in Denmark. I hae been seton here, man and boy  
    thirty years.
  Ham. How long will a man lie i th earth ere he rot
  Clown. Faith, if a be not rotten before a die as we hae many
    pocky corses nowadays that will scarce hold the laying in, I
    will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will last
    you nine year.
  Ham. Why he more than another
  Clown. Why, sir, his hide is so tannd with his trade that a will
    keep out water a great while and your water is a sore decayer of
    your whoreson dead body. Heres a skull now. This skull hath lien
    you i th earth threeandtwenty years.
  Ham. Whose was it
  Clown. A whoreson, mad fellows it was. Whose do you think it was
  Ham. Nay, I know not.
  Clown. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue A pourd a flagon of
    Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yoricks
    skull, the Kings ester.
  Ham. This
  Clown. Een that.
  Ham. Let me see. Takes the skull. Alas, poor Yorick I knew him,  
    Horatio. A fellow of infinite est, of most ecellent fancy. He
    hath borne me on his back a thousand tunes. And now how abhorred
    in my imagination it is My gorge rises at it. Here hung those
    lips that I hae kissd I know not how oft. Where be your gibes
    now your gambols your songs your flashes of merriment that
    were wont to set the table on a roar Not one now, to mock your
    own grinning uite chap falln Now get you to my ladys
    chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
    faour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio,
    tell me one thing.
  Hor. Whats that, my lord
  Ham. Dost thou think Aleander lookd o this fashion i th earth
  Hor. Een so.
  Ham. And smelt so Pah
                                          Puts down the skull.
  Hor. Een so, my lord.
  Ham. To what base uses we may return, Horatio Why may not
    imagination trace the noble dust of Aleander till he find it
    stopping a bunghole
  Hor. Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.  
  Ham. No, faith, not a ot but to follow him thither with modesty
    enough, and likelihood to lead it as thus Aleander died,
    Aleander was buried, Aleander returneth into dust the dust is
    earth of earth we make loam and why of that loam whereto he
    was conerted might they not stop a beer barrel
    Imperious Caesar, dead and turnd to clay,
    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
    O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
    Should patch a wall t epel the winters flaw
    ut soft but soft aside Here comes the King

    Enter priests with a coffin in funeral procession, King,
             ueen, Laertes, with Lords attendant.

    The ueen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow
    And with such maimed rites This doth betoken
    The corse they follow did with desprate hand
    Fordo it own life. Twas of some estate.
    Couch we awhile, and mark.
                                         Retires with Horatio.  
  Laer. What ceremony else
  Ham. That is Laertes,
    A ery noble youth. Mark.
  Laer. What ceremony else
  Priest. Her obseuies hae been as far enlargd
    As we hae warranty. Her death was doubtful
    And, but that great command oersways the order,
    She should in ground unsanctified hae lodgd
    Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,
    Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.
    Yet here she is allowd her irgin crants,
    Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
    Of bell and burial.
  Laer. Must there no more be done
  Priest. No more be done.
    We should profane the serice of the dead
    To sing a reuiem and such rest to her
    As to peaceparted souls.
  Laer. Lay her i th earth
    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh  
    May iolets spring I tell thee, churlish priest,
    A ministring angel shall my sister be
    When thou liest howling.
  Ham. What, the fair Ophelia
  ueen. Sweets to the sweet Farewell.
                                             Scatters flowers.
    I hopd thou shouldst hae been my Hamlets wife
    I thought thy bridebed to hae deckd, sweet maid,
    And not hae strewd thy grae.
  Laer. O, treble woe
    Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
    Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
    Deprid thee of Hold off the earth awhile,
    Till I hae caught her once more in mine arms.

    Now pile your dust upon the uick and dead
    Till of this flat a mountain you hae made
    T oertop old Pelion or the skyish head
    Of blue Olympus.
  Ham. comes forward What is he whose grief  
    ears such an emphasis whose phrase of sorrow
    Conures the wandring stars, and makes them stand
    Like wonderwounded hearers This is I,
    Hamlet the Dane.                    Leaps in after Laertes.
  Laer. The deil take thy soul
                                            Grapples with him.
  Ham. Thou prayst not well.
    I prithee take thy fingers from my throat
    For, though I am not splenitie and rash,
    Yet hae I in me something dangerous,
    Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand
  King. Pluck thein asunder.
  ueen. Hamlet, Hamlet
  All. Gentlemen
  Hor. Good my lord, be uiet.
             The Attendants part them, and they come out of the
                                                         grae.
  Ham. Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
    ntil my eyelids will no longer wag.
  ueen. O my son, what theme  
  Ham. I lod Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
    Could not with all their uantity of loe
    Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her
  King. O, he is mad, Laertes.
  ueen. For loe of God, forbear him
  Ham. Swounds, show me what thout do.
    Woot weep woot fight woot fast woot tear thyself
    Woot drink up esill eat a crocodile
    Ill dot. Dost thou come here to whine
    To outface me with leaping in her grae
    e buried uick with her, and so will I.
    And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
    Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
    Singeing his pate against the burning one,
    Make Ossa like a wart Nay, an thoult mouth,
    Ill rant as well as thou.
  ueen. This is mere madness
    And thus a while the fit will work on him.
    Anon, as patient as the female doe
    When that her golden couplets are disclosd,  
    His silence will sit drooping.
  Ham. Hear you, sir
    What is the reason that you use me thus
    I lod you eer. ut it is no matter.
    Let Hercules himself do what he may,
    The cat will mew, and dog will hae his day.
Eit.
  King. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
                                                   Eit Horatio.
    To Laertes Strengthen your patience in our last nights speech.
    Well put the matter to the present push.
    Good Gertrude, set some watch oer your son.
    This grae shall hae a liing monument.
    An hour of uiet shortly shall we see
    Till then in patience our proceeding be.
                                                         Eeunt.




Scene II.
Elsinore. A hall in the Castle.

Enter Hamlet and Horatio.

  Ham. So much for this, sir now shall you see the other.
    You do remember all the circumstance
  Hor. Remember it, my lord
  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
    That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
    Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly
    And praisd be rashness for it let us know,
    Our indiscretion sometime seres us well
    When our deep plots do pall and that should learn us
    Theres a diinity that shapes our ends,
    Roughhew them how we will
  Hor. That is most certain.
  Ham. p from my cabin,
    My seagown scarfd about me, in the dark
    Gropd I to find out them had my desire,
    Fingerd their packet, and in fine withdrew
    To mine own room again making so bold  
    My fears forgetting manners to unseal
    Their grand commission where I found, Horatio
    O royal knaery, an eact command,
    Larded with many seeral sorts of reasons,
    Importing Denmarks health, and Englands too,
    With, hoo such bugs and goblins in my life
    That, on the superise, no leisure bated,
    No, not to stay the finding of the ae,
    My head should be struck off.
  Hor. Ist possible
  Ham. Heres the commission read it at more leisure.
    ut wilt thou bear me how I did proceed
  Hor. I beseech you.
  Ham. eing thus benetted round with illanies,
    Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
    They had begun the play. I sat me down
    Deisd a new commission wrote it fair.
    I once did hold it, as our statists do,
    A baseness to write fair, and labourd much
    How to forget that learning but, sir, now  
    It did me yeomans serice. Wilt thou know
    Th effect of what I wrote
  Hor. Ay, good my lord.
  Ham. An earnest conuration from the King,
    As England was his faithful tributary,
    As loe between them like the palm might flourish,
    As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
    And stand a comma tween their amities,
    And many suchlike ass of great charge,
    That, on the iew and knowing of these contents,
    Without debatement further, more or less,
    He should the bearers put to sudden death,
    Not shriing time allowd.
  Hor. How was this seald
  Ham. Why, een in that was heaen ordinant.
    I had my fathers signet in my purse,
    which was the model of that Danish seal
    Folded the writ up in the form of th other,
    Subscribd it, gaet th impression, placd it safely,
    The changeling neer known. Now, the net day  
    Was our seafight and what to this was seuent
    Thou knowst already.
  Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencrant go tot.
  Ham. Why, man, they did make loe to this employment
    They are not near my conscience their defeat
    Does by their own insinuation grow.
    Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
    etween the pass and fell incensed points
    Of mighty opposites.
  Hor. Why, what a king is this
  Ham. Does it not, thinkst thee, stand me now upon
    He that hath killd my king, and whord my mother
    Poppd in between th election and my hopes
    Thrown out his angle for my Proper life,
    And with such conage ist not perfect conscience
    To uit him with this arm And ist not to be damnd
    To let this canker of our nature come
    In further eil
  Hor. It must be shortly known to him from England
    What is the issue of the business there.  
  Ham. It will be short the interim is mine,
    And a mans life is no more than to say one.
    ut I am ery sorry, good Horatio,
    That to Laertes I forgot myself,
    For by the image of my cause I see
    The portraiture of his. Ill court his faours.
    ut sure the braery of his grief did put me
    Into a towring passion.
  Hor. Peace Who comes here

                 Enter young Osric, a courtier.

  Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
  Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. Aside to Horatio Dost know this
    waterfly
  Hor. aside to Hamlet No, my good lord.
  Ham. aside to Horatio Thy state is the more gracious for tis a
    ice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile. Let a beast be
    lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the kings mess. Tis
    a chough but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.  
  Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart
    a thing to you from his Maesty.
  Ham. I will receie it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put your
    bonnet to his right use. Tis for the head.
  Osr. I thank your lordship, it is ery hot.
  Ham. No, beliee me, tis ery cold the wind is northerly.
  Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
  Ham. ut yet methinks it is ery sultry and hot for my compleion.
  Osr. Eceedingly, my lord it is ery sultry, as twere I cannot
    tell how. ut, my lord, his Maesty bade me signify to you that
    he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the matter
  Ham. I beseech you remember.
                           Hamlet moes him to put on his hat.
  Osr. Nay, good my lord for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is
    newly come to court Laertes beliee me, an absolute gentleman,
    full of most ecellent differences, of ery soft society and
    great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card
    or calendar of gentry for you shall find in him the continent of
    what part a gentleman would see.
  Ham. Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you though, I  
    know, to diide him inentorially would doy th arithmetic of
    memory, and yet but yaw neither in respect of his uick sail.
    ut, in the erity of etolment, I take him to be a soul of great
    article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make
    true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who else
    would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
  Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
  Ham. The concernancy, sir Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
    rawer breath
  Osr. Sir
  Hor aside to Hamlet Ist not possible to understand in another
    tongue You will dot, sir, really.
  Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman
  Osr. Of Laertes
  Hor. aside His purse is empty already. Alls golden words are
    spent.
  Ham. Of him, sir.
  Osr. I know you are not ignorant
  Ham. I would you did, sir yet, in faith, if you did, it would not
    much approe me. Well, sir  
  Osr. You are not ignorant of what ecellence Laertes is
  Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
    ecellence but to know a man well were to know himself.
  Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon but in the imputation laid on him
    by them, in his meed hes unfellowed.
  Ham. Whats his weapon
  Osr. Rapier and dagger.
  Ham. Thats two of his weapons but well.
  Osr. The King, sir, hath wagerd with him si arbary horses
    against the which he has impond, as I take it, si French
    rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and
    so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are ery dear to fancy,
    ery responsie to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
    ery liberal conceit.
  Ham. What call you the carriages
  Hor. aside to Hamlet I knew you must be edified by the margent
    ere you had done.
  Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
  Ham. The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
    carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then.  
    ut on Si arbary horses against si French swords, their
    assigns, and three liberalconceited carriages thats the French
    bet against the Danish. Why is this all impond, as you call it
  Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a doen passes between
    yourself and him, he shall not eceed you three hits he hath
    laid on twele for nine, and it would come to immediate trial
    if your lordship would ouchsafe the answer.
  Ham. How if I answer no
  Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
  Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Maesty,
    it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be
    brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his purpose,
    I will win for him if I can if not, I will gain nothing but my
    shame and the odd hits.
  Osr. Shall I redelier you een so
  Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
  Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.
  Ham. Yours, yours. Eit Osric. He does well to commend it
    himself there are no tongues else fors turn.
  Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.  
  Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suckd it. Thus has he,
    and many more of the same bey that I know the drossy age dotes
    on, only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter
    a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and
    through the most fannd and winnowed opinions and do but blow
    them to their trialthe bubbles are out,

                            Enter a Lord.

  Lord. My lord, his Maesty commended him to you by young Osric, who
    brings back to him, that you attend him in the hall. He sends to
    know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will
    take longer time.
  Ham. I am constant to my purposes they follow the Kings pleasure.
    If his fitness speaks, mine is ready now or whensoeer, proided
    I be so able as now.
  Lord. The King and ueen and all are coming down.
  Ham. In happy time.
  Lord. The ueen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
    Laertes before you fall to play.  
  Ham. She well instructs me.
                                                    Eit Lord.
  Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.
  Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France I hae been in
    continual practice. I shall win at the odds. ut thou wouldst not
    think how ill alls here about my heart. ut it is no matter.
  Hor. Nay, good my lord 
  Ham. It is but foolery but it is such a kind of gaingiing as
    would perhaps trouble a woman.
  Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall their
    repair hither and say you are not fit.
  Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury theres a special proidence in
    the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, tis not to come, if it be
    not to come, it will be now if it be not now, yet it will come
    the readiness is all. Since no man knows aught of what he leaes,
    what ist to leae betimes Let be.

    Enter King, ueen, Laertes, Osric, and Lords, with other
              Attendants with foils and gauntlets.
               A table and flagons of wine on it.  

  King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
                    The King puts Laertes hand into Hamlets.
  Ham. Gie me your pardon, sir. I hae done you wrong
    ut pardont, as you are a gentleman.
    This presence knows,
    And you must needs hae heard, how I am punishd
    With sore distraction. What I hae done
    That might your nature, honour, and eception
    Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
    Wast Hamlet wrongd Laertes Neer Hamlet.
    If Hamlet from himself be taken away,
    And when hes not himself does wrong Laertes,
    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
    Who does it, then His madness. Ift be so,
    Hamlet is of the faction that is wrongd
    His madness is poor Hamlets enemy.
    Sir, in this audience,
    Let my disclaiming from a purposd eil
    Free me so far in your most generous thoughts  
    That I hae shot my arrow oer the house
    And hurt my brother.
  Laer. I am satisfied in nature,
    Whose motie in this case should stir me most
    To my reenge. ut in my terms of honour
    I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement
    Till by some elder masters of known honour
    I hae a oice and precedent of peace
    To keep my name ungord. ut till that time

    Or uit in answer of the third echange,
    Let all the battlements their ordnance fire
    The King shall drink to Hamlets better breath,
    And in the cup an union shall he throw
    Richer than that which four successie kings
    In Denmarks crown hae worn. Gie me the cups
    And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
    The trumpet to the cannoneer without,  
    The cannons to the heaens, the heaen to earth,

  Osr. Nothing neither way.
  Laer. Hae at you now

  ueen. No, no the drink, the drink O my dear Hamlet
    The drink, the drink I am poisond.                 Dies.
  Ham. O illany Ho let the door be lockd.
    Treachery Seek it out.
                                                Laertes falls.
  Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain
    No medicine in the world can do thee good.
    In thee there is not half an hour of life.
    The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
    nbated and enenomd. The foul practice
    Hath turnd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,
    Neer to rise again. Thy mothers poisond.
    I can no more. The King, the Kings to blame.  
  Ham. The point enenomd too
    Then, enom, to thy work.                    Hurts the King.
  All. Treason treason
  King. O, yet defend me, friends I am but hurt.
  Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murdrous, damned Dane,
    Drink off this potion Is thy union here
    Follow my mother.                                 King dies.
  Laer. He is ustly serd.
    It is a poison temperd by himself.
    Echange forgieness with me, noble Hamlet.
    Mine and my fathers death come not upon thee,
    Nor thine on me                                       Dies.
  Ham. Heaen make thee free of it I follow thee.
    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched ueen, adieu
    You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
    That are but mutes or audience to this act,
    Had I but time as this fell sergeant, Death,
    Is strict in his arrest O, I could tell you
    ut let it be. Horatio, I am dead
    Thou list report me and my cause aright  
    To the unsatisfied.
  Hor. Neer beliee it.
    I am more an antiue Roman than a Dane.
    Heres yet some liuor left.
  Ham. As thart a man,
    Gie me the cup. Let go y heaen, Ill hat.
    O good Horatio, what a wounded name
    Things standing thus unknown shall lie behind me
    If thou didst eer hold me in thy heart,
    Absent thee from felicity awhile,
    And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
    To tell my story.         March afar off, and shot within.
    What warlike noise is this
  Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conuest come from Poland,
    To the ambassadors of England gies
    This warlike olley.
  Ham. O, I die, Horatio
    The potent poison uite oercrows my spirit.
    I cannot lie to hear the news from England,
    ut I do prophesy th election lights  
    On Fortinbras. He has my dying oice.
    So tell him, with th occurrents, more and less,
    Which hae solicited the rest is silence.             Dies.
  Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest
                                                 March within.
    Why does the drum come hither

    Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassadors, with Drum,
                  Colours, and Attendants.

  Fort. Where is this sight
  Hor. What is it you will see
    If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
  Fort. This uarry cries on haoc. O proud Death,
    What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
    That thou so many princes at a shot
    So bloodily hast struck.
  Ambassador. The sight is dismal
    And our affairs from England come too late.  
    The ears are senseless that should gie us bearing
    To tell him his commandment is fulfilld
    That Rosencrant and Guildenstern are dead.
    Where should We hae our thanks
  Hor. Not from his mouth,
    Had it th ability of life to thank you.
    He neer gae commandment for their death.
    ut since, so ump upon this bloody uestion,
    You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
    Are here arrid, gie order that these bodies
    High on a stage be placed to the iew
    And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
    How these things came about. So shall You hear
    Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts
    Of accidental udgments, casual slaughters
    Of deaths put on by cunning and forcd cause
    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
    Falln on th inentors heads. All this can I
    Truly delier.
  Fort. Let us haste to hear it,  
    And call the noblest to the audience.
    For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
    I hae some rights of memory in this kingdom
    Which now, to claim my antage doth inite me.
  Hor. Of that I shall hae also cause to speak,
    And from his mouth whose oice will draw on more.
    ut let this same be presently performd,
    Een while mens minds are wild, lest more mischance
    On plots and errors happen.
  Fort. Let four captains
    ear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage
    For he was likely, had he been put on,
    To hae prod most royally and for his passage
    The soldiers music and the rites of war
    Speak loudly for him.
    Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
    ecomes the field but here shows much amiss.
    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
            Eeunt marching after the which a peal of ordnance
                                                   are shot off.  


THE END
